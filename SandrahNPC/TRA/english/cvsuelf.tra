@4    = ~Sandrah? Sandrah of Waterdeep? You will not remember me, small as you have been. You were here once with your father. We know you well and you are scarcely an outsider.~
@5    = ~My memory is truly vague of the elven cities I have seen in my youth. Only the feeling they gave me has remained. It is not present here at the moment but we will soon restore it again.~
@6    = ~You all go with the blessings of Rillifane, my friends.~
