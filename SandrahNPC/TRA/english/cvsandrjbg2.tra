@0    = ~(Sandrah awaits you with her lovely smile.) What can I do for you, <CHARNAME>?~
@1    = ~Kiss me, darling, don't ask why, just do it. (No answer can come from her as you have already sealed her mouth with your hungry lips.)~
@2    = ~When I look at you I am convinced for a short moment that Toril is wonderful place.~
@3    = ~Even after all we've been through together I discover each day anew how much I love you.~
@4    = ~Regardless of the experiences we make you are the one closest to my heart - forever.~
@5    = ~Are we on the way to find a place for settling down after all our wandering the Realms, my counsellor?~
@6    = ~Look, the stars are out again, Sandrah. I wish I could read your mind now.~
@7    = ~The stars are out again, Sandrah. I wish I could read your mind now.~
@8    = ~(As you come close you smell the light fragrance of her daytime perfume.)~
@9    = ~(Lingering lightly above all the staleness of the dungeon air your nose catches a breeze of Sandrah's perfume - fresh as a sunlit meadow full of flowers.) ~
@10   = ~(As you come close you smell the tempting refined perfume Sandrah has put on together with her shimmering evening gown.)~
@11   = ~Sandrah, how did it happen that you were not captured by Irenicus' roustabouts in that ambush.~
@12   = ~Sandrah, how did it happen that you were sent to find us here in this dungeon.~
@13   = ~Please continue with your report about our kidnapping and your finding us.~
@14   = ~Sandrah, are you familiar with the studies of Narvantial of Soubar?~
@15   = ~We were talking about children the other day, Sandrah, and about my heritage in this context.~
@16   = ~You have already taken a look around town, counsellor. Where do we start our search for our *besta friend*, you think?~
@17   = ~Those slavers in the Copper Coronet have angered you deeply, Sandrah, especially what they did to the children.~
@18   = ~Adrian?~
@19   = ~Aran?~
@20   = ~You have not told our orc princess the whole truth about Sharkta Fai, right?~
@21   = ~(You take a deep breath) Let us enter that pool now, Sandrah.~
@22   = ~(You take a quiet moment to embrace Sandrah kindly.) The freeing of those slaves, especially the children has both agitated and relieved you, Sandrah.~
@23   = ~Sandrah, have you ever heard or met this mage Lief. Is he to be trusted or may this be another trap misusing your father's name?~
@24   = ~Sandrah, as a priestess of Mystra you are probably the best suitable counsellor in matters of this planar sphere.~
@25   = ~This talking skull, Kangaxx, he's a lich, right, Sandrah?~
@26   = ~Sandrah, I have thought long about your relationship to Drizzt and your will to help him in his quest.~
@27   = ~Who - or what - do you think Pelligram really is?~
@28   = ~We talked about Pelligram recently and I remember we made the assumption that your Goddess Mystra arranged for the two of you to meet.~
@29   = ~How may our wildcat Shar-Teel be faring these days?~
@30   = ~My counsellor, can you tell me something about Purskul?~
@31   = ~Sandrah, we are quickly running out of acid arrows. Can you provide us with some once again?~
@32   = ~So murderous thieves or deadly vampires, those are the two choices we have to deal with to help Imoen. What do you think is the better one, counsellor?~
@33   = ~Sandrah, can you elaborate a bit on the machinations of that Szass Tam? I don't think I have fully understood the threat to Toril and beyond.~
@34   = ~I think we should continue our talk about Szass Tan's experiments and his use of the dead heroes.~
@35   = ~Say, my counsellor, do you know any lore about Eshpurta?~
@36   = ~Sandrah, I have dreamt of you and Mystra last night...~
@37   = ~Sandrah, you have heard our options how to get access to Lyrars. I'd like to hear my counsellor's advice on it.~
@38   = ~Let us talk about what to do with the Lich parts we have found, Sandrah.~
@39   = ~This mage Mekrath...has he really transported to the Nine Hells with his last spell as you have cursed him?~
@40   = ~I really want to find out about that crazy tanner and especially about the people that employ such a beast.~
@41   = ~A while ago you declared your concerns about Necromancy. I understood that Mystra and thus her priestess oppose to those practices.~
@42   = ~Sandrah, have you ever heard about this *Cult of the Unseeing Eye*? ~
@43   = ~Let us now enter that portal.~
@44   = ~Sandrah, I wonder, when all of this adventuring will be finished one day, have you ever imagined yourself as a mother of your own children?~
@45   = ~How can we go about this mystery of the missing knights, my counsellor?~
@46   = ~What had that Angelo to tell you so urgently?~
@47   = ~Did you have the time already to acquaint yourself with the affliction of our new comrade Zaiya - a challenge for your healing skills?~
@48   = ~Do you think it was a mistake to accept Bodhi's offer to reach Brynlaw?~
@49   = ~I think it's time again to retutn to Amn, Sandrah.~
@50   = ~Your hammer seems to be stuck.~
@51   = ~Never mind.~
@52   = ~You made that choice out of love, out of loyalty...for Imoen. You are not becoming an evil person by this alliance (not if I can prevent it).~
@53   = ~I had hoped you would understand it, your words lift a burden from my soul.~
@54   = ~I don't think it makes much difference compared to the Shadow Thieves, a bunch of murderers and criminals, doesn't it?~
@55   = ~Whether we fight with vampires against murderers or vice versa - it makes little difference. Anyway we clean the town from some subjects it can do without.~
@56   = ~Bodhi is closer to Irenicus than anyone else we have met yet. We may get a chance to gain a bit more insight to who our mighty opponent really is. She thinks you are on her leash now...but by this we always will know where SHE is and what her plans are.~
@57   = ~Sigh, I'm afraid not all our comrades look at it in this cold analytic way, still I agree with your view.~
@58   = ~(Smile) This is my counsellor through and through...you see the light even in the darkness of these tombs and graves surrounding the vampire.~
@59   = ~I'm glad, we are in agreement. Those were exactly my considerations when choosing her side.~
@60   = ~You may have noticed she is a wild mage. Her affliction is not so much an illness to be cured by a healer but rather the effect of the use of wild magic as such.~
@61   = ~I have not often heard you reject a patient in need of help, Sandrah.~
@62   = ~Do you declare her a helpless case already?~
@63   = ~Does your goddess condemn the wild mages so you reject her in that way?~
@64   = ~It seems you misunderstand the issues of wild magic, <CHARNAME>. It is the purest and oldest form of arcane skills, once wielded by Mystril herself with powerful but also with radical effects.~
@65   = ~While all arcanists accept the fact that magic is a powerful and often unpredictable force, most believe that through the proper training and diligence it is something that one can learn to control. Wild mages, however, reject this precept, believing instead that controlling arcane magic is a futile goal that only limits one's potential to preconceived ideas of order.~
@66   = ~Are they so wrong in that?~
@67   = ~They seem to have a point there. Or are they mislead?~
@68   = ~No, they are not. My goddess did likewise before she became the more *civilized* Mystra and Keeper of the Weave. See, a wild mage embraces the randomness of unrefined wild magic, channelling it through the own body like an electrical current, rather than trying to contain or control it. In many cases, this gives wild mages a degree of power uncommon to other mages.~
@69   = ~At other times, however, the forces with which a wild mage dabbles backfire, a risk that all wild mages accept as a natural consequence of playing with fire.~
@70   = ~This lesson was learned at a high prize by Mystra and her dark counterpart Shar long ages ago.~
@71   = ~If the side-effects are such chaotic I understand your difficulty in finding a cure for Zaiya.~
@72   = ~I may even worsen her conditions if I tried to meddle with symptoms that evade me completely as they have their source in the unpredictable. However - I may be able to give her a bit of relieve and extra time should our quests delay our finding of help for her. I cannot guarantee success and I hope we must not make use of that last straw.~
@73   = ~He witnessed Sarevok's death only pretending to be dead himself, knowing we would not pay the minions too much attention once they were out of our way.~
@74   = ~Let me check it.~
@75   = ~I am sorry if I look at it more pessimistic, <CHARNAME>. Your stronghold and the related responsibility is just a temporary thing, not yet a home. It is a step on our road even if it is an important one.~
@76   = ~For me it is important and I will do my best to fulfil my duties with the stronghold.~
@77   = ~For me each step of the road is important. It's one step closer to my goals.~
@78   = ~It's my intention to get as much benefit from the stronghold as I can before I have to drop it.~
@79   = ~Do you remember the two new constellations we first saw on the Sword Coast?~
@80   = ~One was related to Mystra the other you associated with an old symbol for Hope.~
@81   = ~Some still believe in the birth of new gods that is signalled by it.~
@82   = ~My mother comes to my mind and what Bhaal did to her. The mystery is still to be solved - by me...by us.~
@83   = ~We cannot be sure if the second child of Khalindra wasn't me after all...~
@84   = ~Bhaal looms over our relationship and he will until we have solved the riddle contained in Alaundo's prophesies.~
@85   = ~The more we learn and the more we experience the closer we seem to get. You cannot betray me with some lover, you can only betray me by changing the foundation of our relationship.~
@86   = ~I will never do that - I will never follow Bhaal's calling.~
@87   = ~Like what, starting to follow the example of a dead god who claims to be my *father*?~
@88   = ~(The fruity notes are so much different from the tempting and seductive smell she wears at night time.)~
@89   = ~(Lost for words you just smile at her.)~
@90   = ~(You blow her a kiss.)~
@91   = ~(Sometimes you think it was a mistake to have turned her offers down way back then.)~
@92   = ~There is a light at the end of every tunnel, <CHARNAME>. ~
@93   = ~There can be a light even within the darkest dungeon if one travels with you, sweetheart.~
@94   = ~There can be a light even within the darkest dungeon if one travels with you, Sandrah.~
@95   = ~The light at the end of the darkest dungeon may come from some demon's hell-fire.~
@96   = ~Any ideas of what to do with this lovely evening? ~
@97   = ~(Quickly kiss her.) I have to get my eyes off you, sweetheart, otherwise I wouldn't be able to concentrate on my task just another minute~
@98   = ~I'm sure we both have the same thing in mind.~
@99   = ~Sorry, but nothing I feel like sharing with you.~
@100  = ~*Sandrah seems to follow her own thoughts already.*~
@101  = ~Please, do not call me counsellor in this matter which is so dear to my heart as well. Or maybe you should...I have to keep my mind clear in order to be helpful for poor Ajantis. He is not dead!~
@102  = ~Is your mind clear enough to contribute an idea about what to do, my dear?~
@103  = ~Sorry, I was just remembering Ajantis and was irritated by the sudden news that he is not dead!~
@104  = ~The next step will be to find out about the nature of this mysterious globe. Where my own knowledge fails and my reasoning is blurred by emotions I would propose to seek advice from those who hold knowledge and wisdom as their domain.~
@105  = ~That would be Oghma's priests - the temple in the dock area of Athkatla.~
@106  = ~(Smiles) No, I have not. I do not have many ideas about how life will really be for me when...if we ever finish the last of our quests. Many changes are yet to come, dear.~
@107  = ~You sound like you think this lifestyle will endure for a significant time for us?~
@108  = ~This is indeed what I anticipate, <CHARNAME>. Even if we finish the tasks we can see today, I think our role on this material plane will not allow us to lead a *normal* life ever. We both have a heritage that bears consequences for us we have not yet fully explored. Some of that may require choices we are unaware of today.~
@109  = ~Hm. My counsellor once taught me that we always have our own choices and no fate is written in granite.~
@110  = ~That is true and I do not think I have contradicted myself here. All I am saying is that the whole perspective of who we are and who we may become is not yet clear to me. There may be quite different opportunities for the both of us than to retire one day and settle down and raise children. It does not mean that I reject this thought - we are still so very young and so much can happen still.~
@111  = ~One can have wishes and dreams nonetheless I think. But let us discuss this issue at another time.~
@112  = ~You would be a wonderful mother, teacher and companion should you chose it one day - I do not have to tell you who wishes to be by your side in that.~
@113  = ~I have never found you so evasive before. But maybe you're just true to yourself in that you do not make choices before the options and consequences are clear.~
@114  = ~I would recommend the underground passage, <CHARNAME>. We have seen the resources those bandits obviously have and a hidden attack here is more efficient than an open assault. Even though, be prepared to meet some unknown dangers down in the tunnels.~
@115  = ~Your eyes are full of love when you talk of her, <CHARNAME>. You will be so happy when the baby comes, I know you as much.~
@116  = ~(Sigh) I wish I could see her and be there with her. I know she will manage everything on her own, no doubt, but this is something for both partners, isn't it?~
@117  = ~Oh, this wildcat will growl and fight her way through, that's for sure. I care for the baby, Sandrah, she may forget her new role as a mother too easily.~
@118  = ~Shar-Teel has grown into a very responsible and caring woman following a high code of honour. We will get the notice when to come to Waterdeep in due time. You can be assured that she, my father and Landrel will find us and provide a means to be there when we are supposed to. In this case here, no news means good news.~
@119  = ~Counsellor, again you are fully right. We have to be here and she has to be there for the moment. It will come to a good end. Still- hm, I simply miss her a bit. ~
@120  = ~So do I. (She embraces you and kisses you dearly.)~
@121  = ~Do you remember how our wildcat....(You continue your way arm in arm with Sandrah exchanging happy episodes from your time together with Shar-Teel.)~
@122  = ~So do I. ~
@123  = ~I admire your restraint to kill this merchant Fael right there. Now we have a chance to pretend we play their game and destroy the whole malicious organization.~
@124  = ~Provided we can get our hands on the blood of a Silver Dragon...~
@125  = ~Swear to me that we will never do such a deed as to kill an old Silver One!! If we want to prove our heroism against Dragons there are evil ones for us, but never a Silver Dragon.~
@126  = ~I had no intention to do such a thing, I don't even have an idea where to find one. I hope my clever counsellor knows of a way how to trick those bastards.~
@127  = ~Looks to me it's either the blood of a Silver One or those slayers may escape undetected.~
@128  = ~A dragon is a dragon for me, I care little. I just want to solve this riddle, that's all.~
@129  = ~I do not have the answer yet, <CHARNAME>, but I am convinced we will find it at the right time. We will destroy this killer gang for sure.~
@130  = ~Maybe on our travels we really find a Silver Dragon - but not to kill it. Those ageless wise creatures have the knowledge of anything that happened on Faerun since the days of creation, I would  be astonished if together we could not find a way to end these perverted criminals.~
@131  = ~You are right. Fael knows that it will take long to find the blood he requires. There is no urgency to act. If everything fails, we can still come back and get the information out of him by force.~
@132  = ~Yes.~
@133  = ~You can really...I confess I am a bit scared by you and how strict you can be at times.~
@134  = ~Long time ago we have discussed about my goddess, <CHARNAME>, and you assumed she was sometimes weak as she is forced by the other gods to grant her gifts to their disciples, even if they are evil. I told you back then that it is one of the tasks of her priests and other followers like the Harpers to intervene in her name if the misuse exceeds acceptable limits.~
@135  = ~I see. So once again I have witnessed such a case today.~
@136  = ~Do not confuse the true followers of Mystra with those cowled wizards that allow any use of magic if you just bribe them enough. We may not be as obvious as they are but very efficient.~
@137  = ~Hm, now that you mention it - are those cowles acting in Mystra's name as well?~
@138  = ~How can you think that, <CHARNAME>? The assumption is almost an insult...No, they are not! They are tolerated at the moment to keep the balance in Athkatla, which is a corrupt city through and through as you have experienced yourself by now. The downfall of the cowled wizards will come for sure and we may be witnesses of it ourselves.~
@139  = ~Let me get this small bottle of extract from acid slime out. Puuh, what a smell.~
@140  = ~The remaining material is around, here is wood and over there are a lot of feathers where a buzzard has devoured his prey. It will not take long.~
@141  = ~We need some material for it, <CHARNAME>, which is not available around here. We will find it in the next forest on our way. I will produce us some arrows then.~
@142  = ~I see, not everything you can do is by magic, it's alchemy and handicraft this time.~
@143  = ~You asked me for some acid arrows some time ago, <CHARNAME>. Around here is all I would need to produce us some.~
@144  = ~Thank you, but our quivers are filled at the moment. I will ask you again if we need some.~
@145  = ~Very good, I almost forgot it, but my counsellor did not. Go ahead, Sandrah.~
@146  = ~There is no lore about this cult yet, <CHARNAME>, we have heard that it just appeared here in town recently. All we have is the information we have received from the priests and prophets here in the temple district.~
@147  = ~ You're right, it is too new to have gone into your encyclopaedia already. But maybe there was something similar somewhere else before?~
@148  = ~Bad luck. It was just a guess there might be something in your tome. Anyway, we will just find it out by ourselves then.~
@149  = ~A good point, <CHARNAME>...Well, there is nothing directly of that strange name, but...~
@150  = ~But...Even if it is just a guess, Sandrah, please tell us.~
@151  = ~Just a second...Well, there is nothing directly of that strange name, but...~
@152  = ~The name itself...an eye that does not see. A creature that just gazes, it is unsafe to look at it so the believers take out their eyes to survive in its presence.~
@153  = ~What would that mean, counsellor?~
@154  = ~Such a creature could be a Medusa or a Beholder, creatures that can petrify or even kill you with their gaze. I would guess it could be a beholder, as there have been such cults to worship these creatures from time to time. Beholders tend to bring people under their control and establish some kind of realm around their habitat. None of such is reported about medusas, they just seem to kill.~
@155  = ~Sounds plausible to me. We should prepare ourselves then accordingly.~
@156  = ~YOU have dreamt of me and Mystra...but...~
@157  = ~Are you angry about that, my love?~
@158  = ~Are you angry about that?~
@159  = ~Are you puzzled by that? Am I not supposed to dream of you, or your grandmother?~
@160  = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I did not mean to be rude - I was just completely confused because I met Mystra in what I think was a dream last night. Tell me more about your dream if you can still recall it, please.~
@161  = ~You and her were standing near the altar in your father's garden. You were talking about your relationship and how your path with me leads you closer and closer to her. And then she gave you some kind of blessing.~
@162  = ~That is exactly what happened in my dream, <CHARNAME>, if it was a dream indeed. I believe it was more since when I woke up I found that my armor had been altered somehow. So the blessing Mystra gave me in that dream has some impact on reality.~
@163  = ~It was so intense that I felt like being there as well. I wonder what that means...~
@164  = ~That is a a larger town to the East, to Riatavin, <CHARNAME>. It had some importance in the past due to its location at the foot of the Troll Mountains. Time and time again the city had to defend itself against all kinds of beastly intruders from that region. Is there any current trouble there that you have got notice of, my dear?~
@165  = ~We have received this strange map from the Kender and the town is marked on it. I don't know if that has any significance for us - but then...some opportunity for an adventurer may lie where it is least expected.~
@166  = ~Purskul is a small mining town, just half a day's travel out of Athkatla. It lies on the caravan road to Trademeet but is not especially significant. Many of the miners there are Half-Orcs but they are peaceful labourers in the mines. Not much more of interest that I can tell you about that town. But trouble can befall any place of which rumour or lore has not reached us yet.~
@167  = ~It is just that we have got that map mentioning the town and I did not know it even existed. But maybe it is worth exploring, some opportunity for an adventurer may lie where it is least expected.~
@168  = ~I told you where I found her, on a mission with my father to the Planesland of Ormoth. I rescued her and we grew up together. In hindsight it seems that our meeting may have been arranged, I was supposed to free her and accept her as my companion.~
@169  = ~You think your father took you on that mission just for the purpose of meeting Pelligram?~
@170  = ~Did your father do that, I mean to provide you with a kind of guardian to protect you in the times to come? ~
@171  = ~Maybe your father is so powerful to create a creature like her to protect his daughter on the missions he knew she would have later on.~
@172  = ~A valid assumption and I thought likewise when I initially discovered some of Pelligram's abilities and found she was surely something more than just a magnificent animal.~
@173  = ~However, discovering and learning more over time, I have now come to believe that my father was just an instrument used to make me meet Pelligram. Even the mighty Elminster would not be able to create a creature like her - I mean she is not a golem or a summoned being. She is a real personality on her own.~
@174  = ~Hmm. For me it sounds like you suspect someone even mightier than your father to be responsible. Your Goddess? Mystra herself?~
@175  = ~There's a chance that she's just a clever animal and the rest is just what we like to see in her.~
@176  = ~It will take a bit of time to provide you with my interpretation, my dear. Do you want to converse about it now or should we postpone the issue to a quiet moment later on? ~
@177  = ~Right, we will talk about it one of those evenings, provided you allow me the time for a bit of conversation before your desire overwhelms us (Smile at her and give her a kiss.)~
@178  = ~Right, we will talk about it one of those evenings, provided I'm still interested then.~
@179  = ~There is no urgent task at hand, Sandrah, so we may as well continue with this topic.~
@180  = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>, I assume that Pelligram is a creature serving Mystra in some way, just like I think Boo, the hamster, was given to Minsc for some equivalent purpose?~
@181  = ~Maybe even Haiass? Why would your Goddess do such a thing - not all of her priests are supplied with such a companion? ~
@182  = ~Why would your Goddess do such a thing - not all of her priests are supplied with such a companion? ~
@183  = ~Boo? A special creature, no doubt. But Minsc is no follower of Mystra as far as I know.~
@184  = ~(Laughs nervously) I am afraid I may sound silly or self-centred, but I think it has nothing to do with being a priestess of Mystra or not. My goddess seems to have specific interests and even some kind of plan for some mortals of this plane. She provides those people with this kind of sendling to accompany their ways.~
@185  = ~It is not silly, Sandrah. I think it has become obvious by now that Mystra's interest in you is a very special one, be it because of your father or because you are her grandchild - or maybe just because you are...yourself.~
@186  = ~Thank you for not laughing. Even if Mystra is responsible for Pelligram's presence with me, it does not mean she is a spy or tool or similar for the goddess. Her task is to accompany me and maybe make sure I have the right support at a given time. Still she remains an individual, a caring and feeling being with thoughts and wishes of her own.~
@187  = ~Sounds like you think of her as almost human?~
@188  = ~Oh, no, I would not insult her with such a comparison. She is of her own kin and loyal to me as much as she is to Mystra. We will never separate and so our way is together - maybe to that goal that Mystra has in mind for us. Still it will be us to make the decisions, not the Goddess.~
@189  = ~I have much to think about for now. I will keep a more open eye on Haiass as well from now on. Thank you.~
@190  = ~I have much to think about for now. I will keep a more open eye on Pelligram as well from now on. Thank you.~
@191  = ~<CHARNAME>, have you not consented to aid him just the same? Or have you changed your mind about that, now that the full scope of that intrigue against him becomes visible?~
@192  = ~You know I am no coward, Sandrah, but I have to weight the interest of one companion against the interest of the rest of our party?~
@193  = ~The missing companions of Drizzt versus Imoen that is?~
@194  = ~Yes, if you want to put it that way...Your own besta friend Imoen.~
@195  = ~Imoen and more, do not forget that Imoen's fate and our mysterious capturer are related and that he was after me as well.~
@196  = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>, I have no way other than to accept your arguments. I dearly hope that we can find a way to solve both quests without the need to split up our forces.~
@197  = ~It is clear to me that Drizzt has no other way than to follow his quest on his own, should it become apparent that we will need to make such a decision. I cannot blame him for his loyalty to his friends and I am sure he understands that I feel the same about Imoen.~
@198  = ~Mh. You are right, there is no use to discuss this issue of loyalty and love unless we find evidence that we cannot solve both problems as a group.~
@199  = ~Will you...Sandrah, will you follow Drizzt when the moment comes?~
@200  = ~You fool...(Sandrah's eyes are icy as she turns and rushes away.)~
@201  = ~I can provide you with what I know myself about the topic but be aware that much of it is scientific theory still and either you will find it utterly fascinating or rather boring.~
@202  = ~Thanks for the warning, Sandrah. I will rely on your knowledge should we ever need it again in the future but I might want to keep your mouth occupied with sweeter things at the moment. ~
@203  = ~I am willing to give it a try, we can stop anytime and, hm, change to lighter and practical things should it really become that theoretical. ~
@204  = ~It seems important enough for your goddess to make an appearance, which I take partly as a proof for the correctness of that theory. ~
@205  = ~(As you start to kiss her, you soon realise that her mind seems to be elsewhere and her reaction is a bit restrained compared to her usual passion. The topic you have started obviously still bothers her.)~
@206  = ~You have probably read a lot back in Candlekeep about Toril and the other planes we know about and how they interact and hang together.~
@207  = ~Well, yes, not implying that I understood it all or even believe in it fully. ~
@208  = ~Well, yes, I have a pretty good background knowledge of the subject. ~
@209  = ~Our world and the other planes including Celestia have one thing in common, <CHARNAME>. They are all manifestations of the matter and energy that surrounds them and is interwoven with them. All we are and see and touch is part of the Weave.~
@210  = ~When I use the power of the Weave in my healing tasks I repair a damage of some part by using a bit of the energy from another part, if you get the picture.~
@211  = ~But what is outside of that sphere the Weave creates for us - or is there even an *outside* of some kind.~
@212  = ~I see what you meant with your warning - this seems to become rather scientific or speculative. Hence we started it, let's get on.~
@213  = ~Maybe it was theory only - until I got a glimpse of it with my own eyes down under Sharkta Fai.~
@214  = ~Some philosophers tell us that there is not such an *outside* and that where the Weave does not exist there is nothing.~
@215  = ~Some say that nothing would be defined as the absence of anything while others would express it as the negation of anything that is...~
@216  = ~Woo, I guess I see where that would lead us to...this dark matter stuff, right?~
@217  = ~Woo, You see it as a proof for the dark matter theory, right?~
@218  = ~Exactly. This *nothing* for our senses and perception is actually *something* - the exact opposite of all we define as being. A negative energy and the complimentary matter.~
@219  = ~If the two meet they eliminate each other, like you and Mystra had anticipated.~
@220  = ~The control of that dark stuff would be the ultimate weapon on our planes, it would just make everything it is aimed at disappear.~
@221  = ~But what holds the two apart, I mean there must be some kind of boundary between them?~
@222  = ~Under normal circumstances the two repel each other like the equal poles of a magnet. In the cases where they really come together on a small scale the result is a kind of black hole in our continuum, a real non-existence.~
@223  = ~What did Szass Tam do with those dead and undead then?~
@224  = ~You know that I do not believe in any afterlife. The reason for that has to do with what we just discussed. But maybe this is a good time to make a break for this day and continue another time.~
@225  = ~Right, my head already spins from all the nothing that is something and vice versa. We may continue another time.~
@226  = ~Oh, I am not tired yet of it, please continue.~
@227  = ~We found that normally the Dark Weave and the True Weave are separated naturally. One of the regular cases the boundary is passed is when the soul essence and the life energy of the dead are transferred to the dark side.~
@228  = ~You mean that this is how we all end and become nothing? ~
@229  = ~But only if we had the dark side and evil in us already in our lifetime?~
@230  = ~At that point in the process we have already ceased to exist, my love. Good or bad or other aspects of our personality have become irrelevant. What happens is just a transfer of energy.~
@231  = ~And that short moment that normally happens unnoticed was used by Szass Tam. As the boundary between the two Weaves opened for the exchange he took that slight moment to transfer some dark matter into his installation. For that purpose he needed  much and highly energised material. The reanimated corpses he could not use and provided to Vennegrat.~
@232  = ~He would need a real slaughterhouse to force a larger opening into the boundary between the Weaves.~
@233  = ~Either that - or the essence of specific creatures...~
@234  = ~Are you referring to a godchild, Sandrah?~
@235  = ~Even more. You heard his words, he would sacrifice our gods for his own ascension. First of all the one who is connected directly to the True Weave herself.~
@236  = ~Mystra!~
@237  = ~Yes, he is, one of the most dangerous in the Realms. The only method the paladins of the joint churches found to end him was to tear his torso apart and hide the parts at distributed places. They could not destroy him permanently, as we have witnessed ourselves.~
@238  = ~What do you think we should do, counsellor?~
@239  = ~The case has just found the competent people to solve it.~
@240  = ~A difficult question, and one we must consider thoroughly. There is no necessity for an answer unless we should discover all the missing parts of his body somehow.~
@241  = ~And what if we did? - He promised us unbelievable rewards. Even if I do not trust him to give them to us without a fight, we may gain much from defeating a such a lich.~
@242  = ~It's just a matter of time for us. Even if I do not trust him to give us our reward without a fight, we may gain much from defeating a such a lich.~
@243  = ~<CHARNAME>, his present state is not such for no reason. If we would restore him, his evil power will once again be greater than it ever was before as such is the nature of liches unless you find a way to destroy them permanently. You would risk all of our lives and our future for such an adventure. There is only one argument I can see why we should ever consider such a deed.~
@244  = ~Which is? ~
@245  = ~Somebody else might find the skull just by chance, like we did. He or she might succeed in finding the pieces which are still existing right here in town and restore Kangaxx. Can you imagine what will happen if such a hateful creature is set free right here in the middle of a Capital?~
@246  = ~We could try to find the pieces of the body without returning them to the lich. In this way we would prevent his restoration by some unlucky greedy fool. ~
@247  = ~If we find just one single piece of the lich's body and keep it secure, nobody else would be able to do something foolish, even if they had all the other parts.~
@248  = ~If we should find a method to destroy the creature forever we would free the Realms permanently from this threat. Anyway we would need to get the pieces first. Until then we will have much time to think and decide about this case.~
@249  = ~I vaguely remember that I have seen his face in my father's house before. A harper and a messenger now and then. I confess I have not paid overly much attention to him, but I think his story is to be believed.~
@250  = ~But we cannot get to Waterdeep to deliver the message, can't we?~
@251  = ~You know my father's tendency to appear at all times and odd places. We will probably meet him in Athkatla or Trademeet one of these days. I suggest we keep the message for him safely. ~
@252  = ~Fine. Thank you, counsellor.~
@253  = ~Angered? That is too small a word for it, <CHARNAME>. I already regret that I killed that bastard innkeeper so mercifully fast. I should have captured him and given him to Shar-Teel and Viconia for punishment. I would have restored him every time those two finished a session with him and then we would start again so he could pay for each and every innocent who had to suffer for this so-called *entertainment*~
@254  = ~Sandrah!~
@255  = ~Are you shocked by my reaction, or by the deeds that even our worst fantasies may not be capable of imagining?~
@256  = ~I think you are right...yes...those people have known no scruples to misuse the helpless and defenceless victims to suffer for their so-called entertainment. They deserve no mercy as they had none for their slaves.~
@257  = ~I hate slavery just as much as you do, Sandrah. It is just...in all the time we are together now, with the hundreds of foe I have seen you kill, this is the first time I have ever seen you being satisfied by taking another one's life.~
@258  = ~I will kill the next of those slave drivers with the same merciless satisfaction, <CHARNAME>, that you have seen today with me. I will tell you the story of it some time, when my emotions have calmed down a bit. It has to do with one of my early missions I ventured on with my father, the one where I also freed Pelligram.~
@259  = ~Her - but also some children?~
@260  = ~Sounds like some horrible experience?~
@261  = ~...yes...some...(She hides her face on your shoulder sobbing noiseless. You have never before seen her so agitated.)~
@262  = ~(There is nothing for you to do but take her in your arms and caress her head until the sobbing stops. After a while she lifts her head and gives you a kiss before she wordlessly motions you to move on.)~
@263  = ~(There is nothing for you to do but take her in your arms and caress her head until the sobbing stops. You just hope she does not misinterpret your action.)~
@264  = ~(She smiles at you.) You are a kind and caring observer. I think I owe you a story about the background of my behaviour by now.~
@265  = ~Sandrah, it is not curiosity but something I have learned from one of the best healers I know - it helps to heal a wounded soul to talk about your sorrows to someone who cares for you.~
@266  = ~Who might that clever healer be...(She smiles again at you but then her face becomes a stony mask.) When I had just celebrated my fifteenth birthday, my father took me once again with him on one of his missions. He prepared me this time by telling me I would see probably some of the darker sides of Faerun's reality and even some bloodshed and death. He was certain I was mature enough to face it, and it had to happen at one point in time anyway. ~
@267  = ~(You take her hand that is slightly trembling and continue to listen.)~
@268  = ~Should a caring father really do such a thing to his daughter?~
@269  = ~He wanted to be by my side when the rough truth and cruelty of the Realms would end my childhood dreams of a fairytale world as he was certain it would happen sooner or later. I am sure even he was unaware and shocked by what we really found on that mission.~
@270  = ~We teleported to a space outside of the village that had pleaded for help. There was an unnatural quietness around the area, no bird singing, no dog barking. As we moved slowly into the village we soon found out why. Dead bodies lay strewn in the streets and in every house, barn and building we examined. The intruders had killed men, women, animals, many obviously in their sleep or before they could even grab their weapons to defend themselves. It had not been a fight but rather a slaughter, eliminating the whole population. Only after some time and when we overcame the initial shock of having come too late, we recognised that among all the dead there where no children and no younger women.~
@271  = ~...oh, my, I fear the worst...~
@272  = ~Ah, I expect the bloody part comes now...~
@273  = ~Rightfully so, <CHARNAME>. It was not so hard to find the trail of the slavers and their victims as their number was large and the nearby desert to where it led showed it well. Also the occasional dead body of a young woman or a child that had either tried to escape or collapsed from exhaustion lined the way. By nightfall we caught sight of the caravan as they were about to stop for the night. I will never forget the sound of hundreds of weeping children and the wailing of the desperate women that were raped by their capturers - not just for their fun but also to breed just right away a new generation to be born directly into slavery...~
@274  = ~My father struggled hard to remain patient himself but he feared that a direct attack with even our whole magical power would cause many victims among the captured, as the capturers themselves had a number of wizards among them. He knew they would use their fireballs and summoned monsters remorselessly not caring how many of their prisoners would die through that.~
@275  = ~While we were still planning our next steps, a young girl of my age had suddenly taken her chance to try an escape and came running directly to the point where we were hiding in the dunes. She was already bleeding and her clothes were torn. More than a dozens of the slavers were on her trail while she came running towards us, running for her life.~
@276  = ~All I remember is that an instant later the first of her pursuers lay dead before my feet while my hammer was already targeted at the next one. Within seconds hell broke loose around us. All I know is that I felt neither pain nor fear, I was just fighting and destroying the monsters that had done what I had seen in that village.~
@277  = ~(You remain silent as Sandrah seems to experience the pain of that battle once again.)~
@278  = ~...all of a sudden everything was quiet around me - too quiet. As I looked around, the ground was covered by human bodies as far as I could see in the dimming light. Then one of the bodies next to me began to stir - my father slowly got up to his feet, unhurt but pale as a ghost and trembling like an old man. Blood was dripping from my hammer onto the face of the girl I had tried to rescue, mixing with her own blood there. But - she slowly began to move and her hand swept the blood from her eyes to look around.~
@279  = ~More and more of the bodies around us began to move and creep and get up to their feet. But many did not...~
@280  = ~(She sighs heavily.) We rescued seven hundred children that eve but more than a hundred and all of the slavers were killed. My father told me later that I reaped most of that bloody harvest among our foe...It was the first time I ever had to take another ones life.~
@281  = ~And you found Pelligram there.~
@282  = ~I found the poor kitten in a cage moaning beside her dead mother. The bastards had killed the mother and left the mangled body for the small one to feed on. We have been companions since that day.~
@283  = ~Thank you for listening. That healer you mentioned was right, it helps to part the pain with a caring soul.~
@284  = ~(She is about to move away but turns around again for one last remark.) The slavers were Red Wizards of Thay with their troups.~
@285  = ~<CHARNAME>, you know well how much I love our Imoen, so do not be disturbed when I say, her rescue is our important goal but not ultimately urgent.~
@286  = ~Not urgent? If I knew you not so well I would call you mad. But I am sure you have a good reason for your statement. So?~
@287  = ~A strange remark, counsellor. Is there some tension between you and my little sister of which I was unaware?~
@288  = ~What? Sandrah!~
@289  = ~Imoen's rescue, <CHARNAME> will be a long term operation to be well planned and organised, not one of those missions to rush into with drawn weapons to save the damsel in distress. And, by the way, if you have not noticed yet, being so close to her, Imoen is far from being the helpless damsel waiting for our immediate appearance. So my advice is to go about with a cool mind in order to succeed.~
@290  = ~Sorry, if I have sounded like I doubted your loyalty. Please, go on.~
@291  = ~Maybe it is good that you have not got swept away by an immediate impulse to rush to the rescue. I will listen to your reasoning carefully, Sandrah.~
@292  = ~I have gained a bit of insight into this city's situation while searching for you after your kidnapping. There is a large turmoil of powers, including the Shadow Thieves, the cowled  wizards and Irenicus and his allies. It looks like for the moment, the cowles have reached a slight advantaged by arresting that strange mage and our friend with their famous *unsanctioned use of magic* law with which they control the town. I have heard rumours of some mysterious prison where they lock away those who violate this law. Where this place is seems to be unknown - sure is that it is not in this town and not reachable by common means.~
@293  = ~Disturbing news, in deed. So how do we find this place then?~
@294  = ~We must find the place, it's for Imoen and I owe that capturer a bit of revenge as well?~
@295  = ~We need more information and we need probably some allies here in town. Through this man Gaylan, it looks like the Shadow Thieves have already contacted us in a way. Before we blindly take up their offer, I suggest we take some time to investigate for alternatives and make our choice when we have a clearer view on the possible options.~
@296  = ~And how do you think we should do this?~
@297  = ~Our appearance here in town was quite explosive, was it not? We have surely stirred the interest of all those playing a role in this plot already. Add to this your own reputation, Hero of the Sword Coast, and you can be sure that we do not have to search very hard. We do not need to find them, they will find us. Meanwhile we should use our time to gather as much background information around town as we can and also try to make acquaintances that might be helpful.~
@298  = ~And what about our little red head?~
@299  = ~Our appearance here in town was quite explosive, was it not? We have surely stirred the interest of all those playing a role in this plot already. Add to this your own reputation, Heroine of the Sword Coast, and you can be sure that we do not have to search very hard. We do not need to find them, they will find us. Meanwhile we should use our time to gather as much background information around town as we can and also try to make acquaintances that might be helpful.~
@300  = ~Imoen is strong, do not forget she is a Bhaalspawn as well and she has grown significantly during our common adventures. Her personality has developed and she can defend herself quite well for the moment. Her situation is maybe not extremely pleasant but her life is not in imminent danger. If either Irenicus or the cowls had intended to kill her, she would not be alive any more.~
@301  = ~Thank you, my counsellor. This conversation has helped me a lot to order my own thoughts and disrupted feelings. I know that your words are not cold analysis but full of love and care for Imoen - and for me. (You kiss her intensively)~
@302  = ~Shortly after you left Baldur's Gate a messenger reached Duke Belt telling him about strange things going on in Athkatla and also that the contact you should meet had been murdered under mysterious circumstances probably involving vampires.~
@303  = ~Ah, that's how we ran into that trap where we were nauseated and kidnapped - but go on with your report, dear.~
@304  = ~Belt immediately asked my father for help who confirmed that he might teleport a small party along the same trail through the spheres you had taken not so long ago to either warn or search you. As I was with my father at their meeting their gaze immediately fell on me and of course they did not even had to ask me before I volunteered.~
@305  = ~I may not deserve this loyalty but I'm glad even more you did it.~
@306  = ~I imagine you couldn't withstand the chance to get your hooks into me again, my vulture.~
@307  = ~The small party that jumped to your landing place in Amn consisted of Pelligram and me. And we found Haiass at the scene of the crime still were the capturers had left him wounded.~
@308  = ~Haiass is here too? What a loyal friend..~
@309  = ~With the animals' help I quickly found the trail that your kidnappers had left not anticipating someone might pursue them. I followed them to the town and their hideout in the Docks. It were Shadow Thieves that laid the ambush and they nauseated you all with a magic cloud spell.~
@310  = ~Pelligram and me observed the building from a hiding place and we had not to wait long until a party left there with suspiciously looking boxes, big enough to hold a body. They moved to a secret and well locked entrance beneath the merchant's arcades.~
@311  = ~And that is where we are now. Please continue. ~
@312  = ~And that is where we found each other again. Please continue. ~
@313  = ~And that is where we found each other again. But we better move on now and listen to the rest later.~
@314  = ~And that is where we are now. But we better move on now and listen to the rest later.~
@315  = ~It were Shadow Thieves that laid the ambush and they nauseated you all with a magic cloud spell to which Mystra has given me immunity.~
@316  = ~I started to fight and together with Pelligram I killed many of them. But there were enough of them to snatch your helpless bodies and transport you from the scene. When I noticed that, I stopped the fighting pretending to flee their overwhelming forces.~
@317  = ~It's good they did not know you, otherwise they would never have believed that you would run away from a fight.~
@318  = ~Thank you for these merits. So - as soon as I was out of their sight, I sneaked back to the scene, just in time to see the last of them retreat, carrying the dead and wounded I had caused. I followed them to the town and their hideout in the Docks.~
@319  = ~When your capturers had vanished into this lair, I decided that you were not in immediate danger, as obviously they had no intention to kill you - at least not right away. I also thought, that a direct assault from me alone against an unknown enemy would not only be dangerous for myself but also for you, who seemed to be still unconscious and helpless.~
@320  = ~I thus spent the next days with cautiously trying to acquire informations about the situation and your possible capturer. I soon found that this was not so easy, as the Shadow Thieves are extremely secretive in their moves - and I soon found they were even more alert, because they found themselves under a kind of siege from some unknown enemy within the city limits.~
@321  = ~Looks to me we have come into the middle of some epic struggle that is just starting in this town. ~
@322  = ~Anyway, this Irenicus seems to be part of that new emerging force threatening Amn, if he is not even the source itself. Those people seem to be interested to strengthen themselves in some way by gaining access to your Bhaal power. This is about all I can tell at the moment. Just the rest of my story then, as it is quickly told.~
@323  = ~While doing my secret inquiries about the situation, I simply hired a handful of street childs to keep their eyes on the dungeon entrance as well as on the thieves hideout in the docks, so I was notified right away when another guild than the one that had captured you made their move against the dungeon.~
@324  = ~The entrance went up in a big explosion and the Shadow Thieves and Assassins made it into the dungeon. I followed them, hiding from them and also from the menagerie of creatures Irenicus had to defend the prison - well, and then I found you.~
@325  = ~Yes, you did, my brave hearted lover, and just in time. (You embrace and kiss her.)~
@326  = ~Yes, you did, my friend, and just in time. ~
@327  = ~There are many aspects about my Goddess Mystra that are dealt with by Narvantial. The most widely accepted of his theories is the human origin of Mystra since the very beginning.~
@328  = ~And?~
@329  = ~Since the very beginning...?~
@330  = ~You must have an opinion on that issue yourself, I guess.~
@331  = ~We both know that this is true for the current incarnation of Mystra, as Midnight is my own grandmother and she was a human priestess and adventurer before Ao elevated her to the Weave.~
@332  = ~What Narvantial claims to have found out is the fact that there has been a succession of incarnations of the Goddess of All Magic and that all of them had been humans before Ao made them wear the godly mantle.~
@333  = ~Why should Ao do such - I mean if anyone can guess at all why gods act the way they do?~
@334  = ~Hm. Remember that Ao chose humans during the Time of Troubles to aid him against the renegade gods. With Mystra's role to rule over the Weave while all the gods in one way or another require access to that source of power at the same time, Ao might have followed a similar concept. Instead of giving one of the other celestials that advantage over all the others, he tasked a *mere* human with it, trusting her more than any other god.~
@335  = ~But why?~
@336  = ~He did well in that, after all I learned about those corrupt creatures calling themselves *gods*.~
@337  = ~Maybe because a human elevated to such power would not so easily join the everlasting competition for more power that seems to continue among the other gods.~
@338  = ~I found something else of interest in a book about Narvantial's studies. I mean the way he made his choices among the human candidates for the task...~
@339  = ~(She remains silent and thoughtful for a moment.)~
@340  = ~I think I know what you mean, <CHARNAME>. His thesis that a specific human bloodline has been chosen by Ao and that all incarnations of Mystra have come from that line - up to my grandmother.~
@341  = ~And is that true, Sandrah?~
@342  = ~(Again Sandrah seems to hesitate.) You can imagine that I have thought quite a bit about that issue, <CHARNAME>. If it were true, it would mean with both Midnight and my father being the only spawns left from that bloodline...~
@343  = ~...then you and your children if you would have them one day are the sole heirs of that blood!~
@344  = ~Provided that Narvantial's theorie was true?~
@345  = ~Are you saying it is not true?~
@346  = ~(This time Sandrah does not hesitate to answer.) To be honest, I do not know.~
@347  = ~See, Narvantial's original studies and papers have not been seen since the Time of Troubles. Nothing of the evidence he may have had for his theory is known. All that is left is the fact that in conclusion from his findings he could foresay that my grandmother Midnight would be the next incarnation of Mystra. Why and how he came to that conclusion is unknown, as well as it remains unknown if the same thing had in deed ever happened in previous times. Which of course means that we have no evidence that it will happen again in the future.~
@348  = ~What about your father or the priests of Mystra's temple? Would they hide such things from you for some reason?~
@349  = ~(Smiles) I do not think so. All I know about this whole story comes from my father and the priests and I am pretty sure that it is all that any living person on Toril knows about it. Why this Narvantial should really have known more about it or even once held some evidence in his hand remains a mystery.~
@350  = ~So the whole story - true or not true - has no influence on you in some way?~
@351  = ~Definitely not. You know me well enough by now. We are responsible for our lives and deeds and it lies in our hands to shape Toril to be the reality we want it to be. I think my grandmother knew that - my father surely knows it - and I believe and act according to that credo too. ~
@352  = ~Hm, I have stirred up something there, it seems.~
@353  = ~You have given me a lot of hope with your knowledge, Sandrah. It is a precious thought that the terrible heritage ends with my generation of Bhaalspawns - unless one of them would raise to godhood.~
@354  = ~Which is something that we will prevent!~
@355  = ~The reason I started this conversation was actually aimed at your own heritage and especially your own relationship to godly blood.~
@356  = ~Do I need to remind you, that my grandparents, although Gods by now, where of human origin and my father was received while both where still in their human form. My father is blessed by Mystra with special abilities but he and my mother are mortal humans, and so am I.~
@357  = ~Yes, yes, I know all of that. But other than the blood of a god in my veins that ends with me, your bloodline continues through the generations - and it is a very special one.~
@358  = ~What are you aiming at, my love?~
@359  = ~We have the evidence that from the same blood that runs in your veins at least two gods - Mystra and Cyric - have been elevated in the past. I say at least, because according to the scriptures of Narvantial there were even more in the past - and there will be future gods coming from that line you represent.~
@360  = ~Oh, no, <CHARNAME>, that is just too much! Shall I think of myself as the possible mother or grandmother of future gods just based on some vague and lost studies of an obscure historian? ~
@361  = ~Forgive me for bringing this topic up. You are right, it's really very vague - and you are surely not the woman to base your decisions on rumours like that.~
@362  = ~It is vague, I agree. But what if there was a grain of truth in the whole story...?~
@363  = ~I should have known it, Sandrah, you would draw your own conclusions and make your own fearless decisions nonetheless...~
@364  = ~(Sandrah sees you approaching her and quickly moves out of your way.)~
@365  = ~(It is apparent that you have hurt her deeply with your behaviour concerning Drizzt. You decide to think some more about your relationship and what she really means to you.)~
@366  = ~(Sandrah looks up sadly to you as she recognises your attempt to start a conversation.) <CHARNAME>?~
@367  = ~Sandrah, please give me chance to apologize for my doubt in your loyalty to me and to Imoen. If there is a way to solve both our quest and Drizzt's quest without parting we will find it - together.~
@368  = ~Sandrah, please let me explain something you might have misunderstood. If really the situation should arise that we cannot support Drizzt's quest any more because of Imoen, I will understand that you will aid him nonetheless. I am sure you two would find a way to rejoin us a quickly as possible and we would continue together once again.~
@369  = ~Yes, we will. It is me who has to apologize, <CHARNAME>, I should have known that by  myself. (Sandrah kisses you on the mouth.)~
@370  = ~This is good to know, <CHARNAME>. If there is a way to solve both our quest and Drizzt's quest without parting your counsellor will find it, I swear. Let me tell the news to Drizzt. (Sandrah kisses you on the mouth.)~
@371  = ~(Your trusted companion raises her gaze as you approach. You know that there is nothing she will not share with you.) <CHARNAME>?~
@372  = ~Share my bed with me tonight and soothe my soul with your love, Sandrah.~
@373  = ~Sandrah, I did never regret my trust in you since the day of our first meeting.~
@374  = ~We talked about Pelligram recently and I remember we made the assumption that your Goddess mystra arranged for the two of you to meet.~
@375  = ~I still try to understand your talk with Irenicus concerning Gorion's dagger. ~
@376  = ~My counsellor, do you know any lore about Eshpurta?~
@377  = ~You are beautiful, my love, even as a drow - or maybe the exotic appearance attracts me even more.~
@378  = ~Will you share with me what this fish priestess had to tell you?~
@379  = ~Will you share with me what this Githyanki had to tell you?~
@380  = ~Was I Bhaal himself for a time when I turned into the slayer creature?~
@381  = ~We need a mind flayer to open the door. Any idea, counsellor?~
@382  = ~We should wait for one in the machinery room in the north with one of the control collars ready. They should occasionally come to inspect the machinery there.~
@383  = ~(Laughs) You are lucky, <CHARNAME>, I am drow only on the outside. Such an impertinent behaviour from a male, I would assure you would learn your lesson very well - and long.~
@384  = ~And how would my cruel mistress punish me?~
@385  = ~First a bit of squeeze torture...like this. (She embraces you and her squeeze is harder than you would imagine from her gracile build but her closeness is welcome in this loveless environment.)~
@386  = ~Next comes the agony of suffocation. (Her lips cut off your breathing and her tongue enters between your lips to steal the last bit of air from you.)~
@387  = ~And last comes the torture you fear the most. (You feel her hand gripping hard but experienced for the treasure in your loins which she claims her own.)~
@388  = ~Oooh,...Mistress, you have to blame yourself for your unruly slave. With a treatment like this to endure you invite him to fail as often as possible.~
@389  = ~Poor me. If your type of punishment becomes known among the poor males down here I will not live long as they would all try to replace me for sure.~
@390  = ~You take your disguise quite seriously - or is that your true nature after all (grin)?~
@391  = ~The *fish priest's* name was Sallinithyl, <CHARNAME>, devoted to her faith and her people even if very different from us.~
@392  = ~Well...yes. We helped them out, so I was not that bad to them, Sandrah.~
@393  = ~Simyaz is devoted to her faith and her people even if very different from us.~
@394  = ~You did well under your rough surface, my heroic adventurer. Maybe the different races will understand each other a bit better for some time. By the way, this warrior and priestess actually was a female of her race.~
@395  = ~So, Simyaz knew who I am and that I come from Mystra's blood from the *Book That Writes Itself*.~
@396  = ~Wow, another of those prophesies that somehow have to do with your grandmother?~
@397  = ~A book writing itself - sounds like its keeping record of something.~
@398  = ~You did well under your rough surface, my heroic adventurer.~
@399  = ~So, Sallinithyl knew who I am and that I come from Mystra's blood from the *Book That Writes Itself*.~
@400  = ~Your brain works clear under the unkempt shell, It sounded like it was the record of the celestial and the priests *since the very beginning*. If that is true it would contain the record of all of my bloodline - as well as probably yours.~
@401  = ~We both know about all of that just too well. We should have read it earlier, but now it seems to be of not much worth for us.~
@402  = ~Will that book reveal anything we do not know by now?~
@403  = ~Yours I understand, priestess, but mine?~
@404  = ~You will be in it as a child of Bhaal I assume. I am in it because of my being a priestess as well as coming from Mystra's blood.~
@405  = ~SANDRAH! If that is true all of the other Bhaalspawns will be in it as well. All those like Sarevok who may want my life because I stand between them and Bhaal's Throne. We must find and read it.~
@406  = ~Would it contain anything you want to know about yourself that makes it worth finding it?~
@407  = ~A valid idea, even if I have not received its location. She said there is a different one for each seeker.~
@408  = ~Who would know about such a place, you think? Oghma's priests perhaps?~
@409  = ~She did not read it careful enough, it seems, as she took me as a descendent of Mystra by the motherly bloodline. We know this is not the case.~
@410  = ~Will it reveal anything else we do not know by now?~
@411  = ~Would the book contain anything you want to know about yourself that makes it worth finding it?~
@412  = ~Nothing I can think of at the moment. Still it is good to have knowledge of the existence of such a thing.~
@413  = ~If another Bhaalspawn would read in it he or she will know about me...~
@414  = ~Who would know about the place where it is kept, you think? Oghma's priests perhaps?~
@415  = ~Those - or Elminster.~
@416  = ~Oh, how much I have longed for that suggestion. (She licks her lips seductively.)~
@417  = ~Oh, why do I hear that wonderful suggestion not more often? (She blows you a kiss.)~
@418  = ~Tonight? This is about a lifetime ahead still. I need some proof of your love much earlier than that.~
@419  = ~Well, then...~
@420  = ~Neither did I. And a long journey is still ahead of us, my love. ~
@421  = ~A common journey.~
@422  = ~Why do you not show me the truth of your words with some action? (Before you can do anything, she lets herself fall into your arms which instinctively embrace her and keep her from tumbling. Her eyes are half closed and her mouth is ready to be kissed.)~
@423  = ~(You touch her lips softly with your index finger to which she responds with her tongue. You lean forward and kiss her.)~
@424  = ~I will never forget that day which has changed my whole life. An irreversible change.~
@425  = ~You wouldn't want to change it anyway, would you. (You do not wait for an answer but embrace and kiss her. Her willing response is your answer.)~
@426  = ~Since that day we have accomplished it to produce something good out of the most hopeless and dreadful situations - time and time again.~
@427  = ~It is our joint strength and love that makes such possible.~
@428  = ~What has happened to you, <CHARNAME>? Do you have any idea why you were kidnapped and taken to this place?~
@429  = ~Imoen reports about experiments done to us. All I can remember is a lot of pain.~
@430  = ~Experiments on you two? That can only mean one thing, the reason for your kidnapping are your Bhaal powers. We were warned already that you would become the target for those who seek to use them for dark purposes. Once we are out of here we should decide about our next steps against your capturer.~
@431  = ~I have met some of our comrades already inside here, I have send them ahead to find an exit on their own. I thought it would be easier to sneak out individually then to draw much attention by moving as a group.~
@432  = ~(Sandrah takes Imoen in her arms.) My besta friend, what have they done to you? We will find the monster who did that and he will pay for it. I am so glad to see you again.~
@433  = ~(Sandrah's face is very grave as she faces Jaheira. You see how she struggles to find the right words for the druid.) Jaheira, at least you are well...I am so...(She dearly embraces the older woman and hides her face in her hair. Only you can see that Sandrah's eyes are full of tears.)~
@434  = ~My fearless guardian, I see you have rescued Boo as well. Pelligram and me have missed you, too. But where is our beloved witch?~
@435  = ~Breagar, you made it as well. Good to see you, old comrade.~
@436  = ~Looks like our capturer has kidnapped others as well. Nice to meet you, I am Sandrah of Waterdeep.~
@437  = ~Hello, I have seen you in the Seven Dens the other day. Had I known you had similar interests to mine, it would have been advantageous to venture in here together. But anyway, the way out will be challenging as well. I am Sandrah of Waterdeep.~
@438  = ~My poor fool, you really needed the company of your counsellor. I hope we will soon find all of them again and well.~
@439  = ~My poor, lovely, adorable fool. (She shakes her head in disbelief about your decision, but a second later she embraces and kisses you.)~
@440  = ~When you see the city outside, I am sure all will be forgotten, Imoen. We will also find the time to look into your lost magic skills with Mystra's help.~
@441  = ~You must be strong, Jaheira...I mean, you are strong. You will see for yourself, my friend. It is best that you see it yourself when we find the way to get upstairs.~
@442  = ~(The mighty warrior weeps in Sandrah's arms like a hurt little boy) Psst, my love, it is not your fault, psst. We will find him and he will pay for that. But now be strong, Minsc. If we fail, he will be out there to harm others like he harmed our Hathran. We will not allow that.~
@443  = ~(Minsk straightens himself to his full height again and nods silently.)~
@444  = ~Count on that.~
@445  = ~A friend of my friend Drizzt. That makes you a friend of mine as well. I look ahead to travel and fight at your side, Wulfgar.~
@446  = ~You have an interesting heritage, Chloe. I can sense something very special about you. I hope we get a chance to get to know each other better. But first let us make it out of this dungeon together.~
@447  = ~Jon Irenicus!~
@448  = ~Someone you know?~
@449  = ~The man who cursed this spider creature - Centeol - we encountered in the Cloakwood Forest?~
@450  = ~The context in which I remember his name had to do with something done to an elf community. But like all these things, the elves hide it in the mist they love to surround what they consider their internal affairs.~
@451  = ~Do you remember that scroll we found in the Doom Mountain when we fought that mysterious hooded creature. It was signed "I." - like Irenicus.~
@452  = ~It really must be someone of great potential and resources to build up a complex like this below a capital city. Foe are getting mightier since we defeated Sarevok, just like you warned me.~
@453  = ~Yes, we heard that name there. The context in which I remember his name had to do with something done to an elf community. But like all these things, the elves hide it in the mist they love to surround what they consider their internal affairs.~
@454  = ~It really must be someone of great potential and resources to build up a complex like this below a capital city. foe are getting mightier since we defeated Sarevok, just like you warned me.~
@455  = ~I would not be astonished if we find out that we already met this man a couple of times.~
@456  = ~The hooded man...~
@457  = ~I owe him a lot already and if he is that hooded man I have double reasons to get a hand on him.~
@458  = ~We are indeed in Athkatla in Amn, <CHARNAME>, very much beneath the center of town. I followed the Shadow Thieves from the merchant's promenade into this dungeon to find you.~
@459  = ~But strange, how come the Shadow Thieves attack this prison, I thought they are in league with our capturers? ~
@460  = ~Yes and no. You were taken here by one group of Shadow Thieves while another group today assaulted this place. As far as I can tell from the little information I could secretly gather, there are different guilds of the thieves operating here, as well as other strange creatures at war with both sides. It is really confusing.~
@461  = ~You did well to operate most secretly, Sandrah, out there alone in a foreign city with what seems to be several parties of power at work. The Shadow Thieves, regardless which guild, are no fun to deal with.~
@462  = ~<CHARNAME>, we are close to the surface and the exit now. There are still dangers ahead, as I tried to avoid fighting when I sneaked into this place. I did not want to endanger you by stirring up our foe with battle noises.~
@463  = ~It's time to face them together now.~
@464  = ~Fear not, my little girl, we are by your side now (Laugh). Let us beat them.~
@465  = ~Vampires! I heard rumours outside in Athkatla that there was a third party somehow trying to get power in the underworld of the city besides the Shadow Thieves and Cowled Wizards. But they were just rumours as those creatures operated only at night.~
@466  = ~First Irenicus as the scroll signed "I." and now the kind of vampires we encountered in his trap in the Mountain of the Dead, what do you make out of that?~
@467  = ~This Irenicus has observed you since quite some time already. Your kidnapping has been planned thoroughly. Only the fact that he has stepped on too many toes here in town has given you the chance to escape.~
@468  = ~Mmh. I will take this chance and use it well. We are warned of him and he will not get us again unaware.~
@469  = ~Wow, we have really arrived at an interesting scene at a time of turmoil. You were right, Sandrah, my heritage does not seem to allow us much rest between adventures, whether we chose it or not.~
@470  = ~Even children! The cruelty of these slavers knows no limit. This exceeds anything that is tolerable! ~
@471  = ~(Sandrah has taken the message you have found on the dead slaver captain Haegan and reads it once again.) ~
@472  = ~Anything you want to share with me, my love?~
@473  = ~I don't like that look on your face - you want to enroll me for one of your silly crusades for goodness again...~
@474  = ~I have not forgotten about it, Sandrah.~
@475  = ~Have you read this carefully, dear? There seems to be another slaver's installation here in town. These bastards, it must be right under the nose of the churches in the temple district. Not even Helm's ever watchful eye seems to be aware of it.~
@476  = ~But you expect us to find what the officials of this town can't find?~
@477  = ~I have seen the scrupulous deeds of these slavers in the Coronet and on their ship-house. If there is another one we will search and destroy it likewise.~
@478  = ~Or what they decide to ignore, <CHARNAME>. If you have not noticed it yet, this capital is corrupt and evil through and through.~
@479  = ~This seems to be the case for any assembly of humans that grows beyond a certain size (Sigh). Even if we have our own tasks, Sandrah, we will never ignore such kind of evil that we can correct. We will find and destroy those slavers wherever we find them.~
@480  = ~Yes, we will, I am glad to follow a leader like you - and to love <PRO_HIMHER> dearly. ~
@481  = ~(You need no further invitation to embrace your beloved and kiss her passionately.)~
@482  = ~Let's do what must be done.~
@483  = ~(Sigh) Sometimes I am proud of what we accomplish, even with the dead it has cost.~
@484  = ~You refer to those slavers? I am glad myself we have destroyed them.~
@485  = ~I do not like this city and the corruption that allows such an installation to exist right in sight of the so-called authorities. I am glad we were able to do just a tiny bit to improve things. I am proud of my companions - and their wonderful leader.~
@486  = ~You make me blush, my heroine. Just for such a compliment I will crush on any such evil installation we may find.~
@487  = ~There is not a temple of Mystra in this district - still, your goddess has been tolerating the situation as much as Helm. There were even some spellcasters among their ranks using Mystra's gift - or shall I say misusing them.~
@488  = ~No, Mystra did not tolerate these misdeeds. She has her faithful priestess and her friends to rely on. We have changed things in her favour.~
@489  = ~That is one possible way of interpretation. ~
@490  = ~If that is so, I understand this as one example of how you do Mystra's work here on our plane.~
@491  = ~A beholder's lair, <CHARNAME>, there is no doubt.~
@492  = ~Uh?~
@493  = ~Your analysis was correct then, counsellor...once again.~
@494  = ~The strange name should have told me that already...an eye that does not see. A creature that just gazes, it is unsafe to look at it so the believers take out their eyes to survive in its presence.~
@495  = ~Such a creature could be a Medusa or a Beholder, creatures that can petrify or even kill you with their gaze. From these tunnels it looks like it really is a beholder, as there have been such cults to worship these creatures from time to time. Beholders tend to bring people under their control and establish some kind of realm around their habitat. None of such is reported about medusas, they just seem to kill.~
@496  = ~And it is a big one if you look at the size of those tunnels. Furthermore this Unseeing Eye is not alone.~
@497  = ~A pirate grove in the middle of town below a renowned inn...hm.~
@498  = ~What do you make out of that, Sandrah?~
@499  = ~A town so lawful and clean on the surface, but scratch just a little...~
@500  = ~In a large town like this nearly everything is possible? It is also some ideal place to hide as it is the least reasonable place the authorities will suspect you to be. If you have friends to protect you, that is.~
@501  = ~The innkeeper, the *Thumb*?~
@502  = ~Maybe one of them at one time. Now a respectable citizen in a town where not too many questions are asked if you have the coin for it.~
@503  = ~And then he harbours his old mates, you mean?~
@504  = ~Maybe he did not volunteer to do so, they may just have used the right arguments to persuade him - like giving his past occupation to the guards.~
@505  = ~My father is a Harper and Gorion was one. Did you ever see such a sign of identification on him?~
@506  = ~No, he knew all the visitors he wanted to speak with and those he avoided as well.~
@507  = ~What do you suggest with that?~
@508  = ~Harpers know each other and they try to avoid any signs visible for others. Athkatla is not bigger than Waterdeep so that such a thing would be necessary. The pomp of this building is a strange thing as well.~
@509  = ~Let us see what else we may find.~
@510  = ~See. <CHARNAME>, the guy over there in that bright red cloak. We have seen that colour before, remember? By the way, it seems his cloak is torn at the right sleeve...~
@511  = ~You are right, Sandrah, the same red cloth that Tirdir tore off from one of his capturers. Well, I think we will ask this man a few questions...not too kindly. I suggest you have your hammer ready just in case he will not cooperate.~
@512  = ~A very strange place for a tomb, do you not think so, <CHARNAME>?~
@513  = ~This town has its secrets almost everywhere. No finding can astonish me here any more.~
@514  = ~Even in a weird town like Athkatla that is true. What do you make out of it, my counsellor?~
@515  = ~Another part of Kangaxx?~
@516  = ~Whoever or whatever is buried here was intended to be hidden from a possible discovery.~
@517  = ~Like what?~
@518  = ~Like that golden skull that has talked to us. He mentioned his parts being close to his tomb but well hidden. This may well be one of those places.~
@519  = ~I remember your advice, Sandrah. We can do no harm unless we retrieve all his parts and bring them to him. We may as well explore this grave then.~
@520  = ~Hm, we will not find out unless we take the next step forward.~
@521  = ~Thank you for the warning, Sandrah. Let us retreat silently before we wake up that beast.~
@522  = ~Like something ancient and evil, something that Helm's paladins would not admit to the graveyard. <CHARNAME>, we have gathered enough experience by now through our adventures to know a Lich's place when we see one.~
@523  = ~A Lich...you are probably right. But now that we have opened the door it is our duty to destroy it before some poor fool encounters the creature by bad luck.~
@524  = ~I am afraid, my hero, that we cannot do that. It would be irresponsible to leave this place open for any poor citizen to enter and be killed. And once it becomes awake just imagine the beast to run free in a crowded town like this.~
@525  = ~I am afraid, my hero, that we need to do just that. It would be irresponsible to leave this place open for any poor citizen to enter and be killed. And once it becomes awake just imagine the beast that guards this tomb to run free in a crowded town like this.~
@526  = ~I guess just that from the design we have seen in the other place. <CHARNAME>, we have gathered enough experience by now through our adventures to know a Lich's place when we see one.~
@527  = ~Another tomb, hidden in an unlikely location, do you not think so, <CHARNAME>?~
@528  = ~Another part of that golden skull lich?~
@529  = ~Kangaxx, yes, that is what I suspect. Do you want my advice at the moment, <CHARNAME>?~
@530  = ~Always, my counsellor.~
@531  = ~I guess I know what to do but let me hear your opinion - probably it is the same.~
@532  = ~Thank you, but I guess we know what to do.~
@533  = ~We should not endanger those blind fools by opening the sarcophagus right now and waking its guardian. Let us deal with the cultist task first and then return to this tomb when we have got everybody else out of here.~
@534  = ~A good proposal, Sandrah. Let's do it that way.~
@535  = ~Good to hear that we both have the same idea about this, my counsellor.~
@536  = ~As much as I love the sound of your voice, I see no need to spare those dumb idiots down here. I will do what I think is right.~
@537  = ~Now we have the control over all three parts into which the Lich Kangaxx had been disrupted long ago.~
@538  = ~Three parts, Sandrah?~
@539  = ~The legs and arms we have found in the one tomb, the torso from the other one - and we know where the skull is. Theoretically Kangaxx can be put together again. If you want to know my opinion about it I would be willing to help you find a decision of what to do with the possibilities we have in hand. You may ask me any time.~
@540  = ~There are many options we have but I would concentrate our talk on two alternatives. As the parts themselves cannot be destroyed by any means we can either put them into a safer place then they were before or we can actually restore Kangaxx. Let me provide you with more details on any of them.~
@541  = ~Is there such a safe place where no ambitious group of adventurers, someone like us for example, can find them incidentally?~
@542  = ~What will be the consequences of *reviving* the Lich?~
@543  = ~We could take them to Waterdeep and to my father's place. Elminster and Mystra will take care of the two pieces we have found and the skull itself is of no danger in its current state.~
@544  = ~Sounds reasonable to me. Let us do that when we get a chance to revisit Waterdeep.~
@545  = ~Let us discuss the alternative then.~
@546  = ~My first assumption is that the Lich will try to destroy us the very instant he has regained his abilities again. He would not be in his current condition if that were not his nature. By all means we must defeat him - not just for our own survival but also for the safety of all of Amn. This monster will not stop his path of death and destruction ever, it feeds on it.~
@547  = ~Do you think we will be able to do this?~
@548  = ~This is however the only way to solve the problem once and forever. We must prepare ourself for this battle.~
@549  = ~It will be a fierce battle, <CHARNAME>, as this Lich is more powerful than any foe we have met so far. His spell potential may kill more than one of our companions before we could even strike a single blow against him. We need at least one holy weapon to strike the final blow against him. Is it really worth it in the end? Consider it well, we are in no hurry to solve the issue today.~
@550  = ~If even you think it is not worth the risk, I don't know. Your courage exceeds that of any person I have ever met and if you hesitate than it is simply that the alternative is the better choice.~
@551  = ~We may think about it again once we have equipped ourselves well enough. You are right, the decision needs not to be made right here and now.~
@552  = ~(Wink at her) Someone I know very well and trust in every respect always says *Do what must be done*.~
@553  = ~I think I prefer the alternative then to solve the problem once and forever.~
@554  = ~I see you are determined to do it. Well, I do not have to stress that you can count on me. I recommend that you study this book again before we set off to do it and make sure we have everything we need.~
@555  = ~This Firkraag has assembled a weird troupe of followers and supporters around him, whoever he might be in reality.~
@556  = ~Have you come to some conclusion already, my counsellor?~
@557  = ~He is surely not a ruler of a land like we would expect to find somewhere else.~
@558  = ~Spit it out already, woman!~
@559  = ~Remember your history lessons, <CHARNAME>. Such a combination of all odd races, creatures, and mercenaries has existed once before, led by an outcast twin couple.~
@560  = ~I am not sure what you are referring to now.~
@561  = ~Are you referring to the Chimera Legion in the north?~
@562  = ~The famous *Maulers* you mean? ~
@563  = ~The Chimera Legion that haunted the Icewind Dale long ago. It was lead by half-breeds with a hatred against everyone and the pure will to destroy. They used the discontent of the outcast breeds to gather a large troupe that threatened to whole North at their time.~
@564  = ~Historically interesting, but can we learn anything from that?~
@565  = ~Firkraag may not be a human even if he disguised as such when we first met him. It is not clear to me against whom of us he bears some grudge but I assume it is very old - maybe not even us personally but Gorion or Elminster, or both.~
@566  = ~Even if you were right, does it help us in any way to find a strategy against him?~
@567  = ~(Laughs short.) Actually just to be prepared for quite some surprises. We have seen part of his strange forces already here on the parameter of his realm. They will surely become fiercer the more we advance and consist of creatures that may be new to us. And in the end the guy himself. Who can he be?~
@568  = ~The best we can do at the moment is to stock up our armour and spells and make sure we can face all sorts of strange enemies that require different combat styles and weapons to be used by us. I'd like to see that Firkraag myself eagerly.~
@569  = ~It is a weird assembly of all types of monsters and creatures this Firkraag has gathered around him but not a real defence of any sorts.~
@570  = ~And what does my counsellor make out of it?~
@571  = ~Remember that he even sent you an invitation of sorts. Surely he wants us to overcome his defences and face him in person.~
@572  = ~So all of this maze is maybe some kind of test of our abilities?~
@573  = ~Not even that. My assumption is that he knows well that we will be able to get to him. Most probably he set up this challenge to spur your interest to pursue him and at the same time get a chance to study you in how you defeat the obstacles in your way. And last but not least he may get some entertainment from watching our progress.~
@574  = ~He is so very sure of himself and his trap. That attitude shall be his downfall.~
@575  = ~Please stay careful. Even if he is arrogant beyond any means he may have a reason to feel so superior.~
@576  = ~Mh, what is he, a Lich?~
@577  = ~May he be a mischievous old dragon?~
@578  = ~Is it a Bhaalspawn again who is waiting for me?~
@579  = ~Have I angered some minor deity to pursue us this way?~
@580  = ~It is a creature with a lot of patience and enough time to wait for the right moment. He has prepared the dungeon and the land around it outside for just this purpose. In addition, he was able to take on a human form and come to Athkatla for you. He plans ahead on long terms to take his ancient revenge.~
@581  = ~The planning excludes the Lich and a god would not spent that amount of time to punish a mortal but strike more directly.~
@582  = ~A Bhaalspawn would not have known about me until recently. This trap and Firkraag's grudge is against me personally and older than my career in the Realms.~
@583  = ~A valid deduction I would say.~
@584  = ~That would leave us with the dragon option, <CHARNAME>. Those deep wells and precipices we passed point in the same direction. His grudge however seems to be much older than our relatively young encounters with his kin.~
@585  = ~Counsellor, you have taught me pretty well how to use my logic thinking in riddles like the present one. It is probably nothing any of us has done to him personally. It must be what I represent for him.~
@586  = ~(She nods thoughtfully) Either you being Gorion's step son, the warden of a Harper - or you being of Bhaal's blood. As he is focussed on you and not interested in Imoen at all the arguments for the first option are weighting heavier, I think.~
@587  = ~Let us be prepared to face an old and angry dragon then, my friends.~
@588  = ~Look at that solemn pathway, <CHARNAME>, may this be the road mentioned on the mysterious map we have received, the place called Innershade?~
@589  = ~Now I have even more responsibility for your health and survival than before, <CHARNAME>. Our beloved Wildcat would skin me alive if I allow anything to happen to you while we travel on our quest.~
@590  = ~(Sigh) You are right, Sandrah, it is wonderful to see the next generation that will follow us one day, but there is also an added responsibility - not just for you. I will have to take my family's well being into account from now on as well.~
@591  = ~Yes and no. Nothing much has changed, as Shar-Teel is not the helpless little housewife awaiting her hero husband to return. She will raise Gorion wonderfully - even if she would have to do it without me, which hopefully will not happen.~
@592  = ~I will have my family on my mind as well as my companions when decisions have to be made. I have learned a bit about responsibility and leadership by now, I guess.~
@593  = ~You have learned a bit about responsibility and leadership by now, I guess. And you know you can always count on a couselor who loves you and Shar-Teel dearly.~
@594  = ~Using my new spell ability we may return to our quest once again. If your heart desires, I can take us on a trip to Waterdeep any time from now on.~
@595  = ~(You kiss her and feel the strength you receive from her nearness.) Let us go then.~
@596  = ~(You kiss her and feel the strength you receive from her nearness.) Before we go,  let us go to the town and temple for some shopping.~
@597  = ~No doubt about that - in the same way she made Waterdeep a safer place even before the child was born. But there are other necessities than just the material ones, like having the beloved father of her child near her often. You know you can always rely on a counsellor who loves you and Shar-Teel dearly.~
@598  = ~No doubt about that - and you can always count on a counsellor who loves you and Shar-Teel dearly.~
@599  = ~Cerendor Hold stands against the Cloudpeak Mountains, north of Crimmor on the north bank of the Alandor River. It is near the caravan town of Crimmor.~
@600  = ~Were we not out to help this town on request of your father, my dear?~
@601  = ~Are you suddenly keen to get a lot of gold, my dear? ~
@602  = ~Yes, sure, and I guess we did - but now that we know of it, we should not let four wagons of the Black Lotus fall into the hands of the underworld who would use it to make unwitting addicts of people. ~
@603  = ~Then onwards to a new quest. ~
@604  = ~Of course it is not the gold - but now that we know of it, we should not let four wagons of the Black Lotus fall into the hands of the underworld who would use it to make unwitting addicts of people. ~
@605  = ~Ah, the fresh air of the Sword Coast. It feels good to breath it again.~
@606  = ~I never thought I would say that, but, yes, it has some feeling of home to me.~
@607  = ~The dull old Sword Coast with its evenly dull peasants - forget it, Sandrah, we're of a larger scale right now.~
@608  = ~We have come a long way together, <CHARNAME>, but one should never forget the own roots and where we hail from. It defines part of our self.~
@609  = ~It was this very air I was breathing when I had my first glance of you on that mournful day long ago. The paths we have shared together since then and the way how we did it give me strength each day again. With that we can move on in confidence. (Your hands meet automatically to walk for a while side by side.) ~
@610  = ~We may be outwardly changed but we have not left ourselves behind. We have gained experience in many ways, <CHARNAME>, but one should never forget the own roots and where we hail from. It defines part of our self.~
@611  = ~The time has come that Garalial Geltarath has announced for his preparations for the release spell on Portpentyrch. We should check the village and report to my good old father then.~
@612  = ~Oh, yes, thanks for the reminder, counsellor. Hopefully we will see the results of that quest by now.~
@613  = ~We have invested quite a bit to rescue that village. Let's go and gain our reward, Sandrah.~
@614  = ~We have already spent too much time for that miserable fishing village. The spell will work without us and your all-knowing daddy will get the news soon enough from one of his many informants.~
@615  = ~Here is a first taste of your reward, great hero. (She kisses you tenderly.)~
@616  = ~(She wordlessly turns away and ignores you for the rest of the day - and the night.)~
@617  = ~So we know at least two ways now to get to Brynnlaw.~
@618  = ~At least. So it may be too early to make a decision already...(Maybe you should ask your counsellor whether you may have overlooked a detail she can help you with.)~
@619  = ~(You shake your head wondering why your counsellor needs to state the obvious.)~
@620  = ~(Maybe your counsellor has some good arguments for one or the other if you decide to ask her.)~
@621  = ~Those are the two we know so far, <CHARNAME>. The two dark and illegal forces that are at war here in Athkatla. But surely not the only powers in this town that may offer access to that island.~
@622  = ~The cowled wizards can be excluded, that's for sure. And the council of eight members are unknown, so we can't access them.~
@623  = ~<CHARNAME>, a choice for the vampires will make all other powers in this town our enemies be it the legal ones or the illegal. But we are sure that Bodhi is the sister of the man we are hunting and therefore knows more about our enemy than anyone else. We do not know what this information is worth and we do not know what we will be required to do to gain it. But in the end, will we not be willing to pay any price for our Imoen?~
@624  = ~Sure, if we must - but is that the best choice?~
@625  = ~Any price, Sandrah? To become allies with the bloodsuckers and the undead - not as long as there are other ways.~
@626  = ~Fine, those are the arguments for that party, let's weight them against the other choice.~
@627  = ~Even if the Shadow Thieves are almost *accepted* as one of the powers in this town and they decorate their activities with the moniker of a *guild* we should not forget that the name itself is a lie. The *Thieves* are merciless killers who torture their victims, deal with slaves or the black lotus...any crime and misdeed you can imagine will be done by them as long as they can gain a profit for that. If you think they are better than vampires just because of their human appearance, you err, <CHARNAME>, they are no better than the beasts.~
@628  = ~If I follow your arguments it would be neither of the two, Sandrah. Not a very helpful advice in this situation.~
@629  = ~Sounds like you recommend none of the two. You sounded like there may be another possibility that may not have shown up yet?~
@630  = ~The information both parties who have approached us so far offer, is not their own, <CHARNAME>, but known to the officials of this town. If the illegal forces have accessed the information it can only be through some *leakage* somewhere in the government. If they have found it maybe we should take a bit of a deeper investigation there. The money our self-appointed friends have required for their aid maybe can open the same door or mouth for us as for them?~
@631  = ~Hm, yes, why not take a look at the government district again. It's on our route any how.~
@632  = ~You see, it does not take long in this town until someone knows about your situation and is willing to show her face.~
@633  = ~So you think this will be another offer to bring us to Brynnlaw? Any idea who that Aster might be?~
@634  = ~Hm, a claim to *take me where I want to go* sounds just like that. Have you heard that name during your stay in town?~
@635  = ~Probably that lady Aster is just a contact person. If my assumptions I mentioned earlier were correct, the real originator of the new offer will remain hidden if ever possible. The order of the Aster follows Lathander.~
@636  = ~You think it's a traitor in the government, if I understood you correctly?~
@637  = ~I would not call that person a traitor, even if he or she or they provide us with a government secret. The motivation may as well be a just one, to use us to act against the Cowled wizards, the Shadow Thieves and the vampire guild that play their game for power here in town. Someone or some group may act out of responsibility and loyalty to the people of Athkatla.~
@638  = ~I take your words as an advice to hear that lady Aster out.~
@639  = ~We can only find out what's behind this by talking to said lady. I will keep your words in my mind when talking to her.~
@640  = ~So you think this will be another offer to bring us to Brynnlaw? Any idea who that Malficus might be?~
@641  = ~Probably that Malficus is just a contact person. If my assumptions I mentioned earlier were correct, the real originator of the new offer will remain hidden if ever possible.~
@642  = ~I would not call that person a traitor, even if he or she or they provide us with a government secret. The motivation may as well be a just one, to use us to act against the Cowled wizards and their corruption, the Shadow Thieves and the vampire guild that play their game for power here in town. Someone or some group may act out of responsibility and loyalty to the people of Athkatla.~
@643  = ~I take your words as an advice to hear that Malficus out.~
@644  = ~We can only find out what's behind this by talking to him. I will keep your words in my mind when talking to her.~
@645  = ~Another of our suspicions has been proven correct, they are brother and sister.~
@646  = ~Bodhi and Irenicus you mean?~
@647  = ~A brother and a sister capture two other *siblings*, two Bhaalspawns, Imoen and you. They are interested in your powers - they want something of it - or maybe all of it.~
@648  = ~Then Imoen is in greater danger than we suspected, they cannot have all of her power without...~
@649  = ~The experiments, the dreams...they want the power but have not yet found the way how to get to it...~
@650  = ~She does not give up easily - but then she has nothing to lose any more. Do not worry, we will get your beloved back from her, we have seen her weakness already.~
@651  = ~Her weakness? She has abducted what she assumed was dearest to my heart.~
@652  = ~And she made a triple mistake in that.~
@653  = ~In which way?~
@654  = ~I wonder why she took her and not you, Sandrah?~
@655  = ~I wonder why she took him and not you, Sandrah?~
@656  = ~She first tried to take me but found me too strong. Instead of giving up her attempt she now has both of us against her plus our task to get the Lanthorne from her. This will be her end.~
@657  = ~You are right, we now have a threefold reason to defeat her urgently.~
@658  = ~Her first attack was to you? She knows my heart's feelings better than anyone.~
@659  = ~Elven law and justice sometimes appears very strict to me.~
@660  = ~Are you feeling some kind of sympathy for that vampire all of a sudden?~
@661  = ~So it is finally confirmed that our enemies are or were elves, even if not much of that was left in Bodhi.~
@662  = ~We have long suspected that some internal elven affair has caused Jon and Bodhi to be expelled from their society. We do not know the circumstances and the crimes they have done to justify their punishment - it does not matter any more as the deeds they have done afterwards, especially to you and Imoen make them our enemies as well.~
@663  = ~You still seem to be far from happy about our victory.~
@664  = ~Oh - I am more than happy that my *besta friend* is hale again and your own restoration is just a matter of time by now. Still, I feel uncomfortable with this being used like a tool in a scheme that is still hidden from us. (Sigh) We need Elhan to access Suldanessalar where Irenicus hides your soul. I really would like to get the truth out of them. We are treated like any other *outsiders* even though they need us desperately in their darkest hour.~
@665  = ~It is a deal and anyway, Irenicus deserves the worst of punishment for the hundreds of crimes he has committed.~
@666  = ~I fully agree with you, <CHARNAME>, Bodhi and her brother have long ago lost their way and any chance to escape their final verdict. Still I am puzzled how any creature can be driven into such behaviour. What did they do and what did the elves do to them that has caused this havoc where thousands of innocent have lost their lives or were otherwise damaged - including my most beloved friends?~
@667  = ~Ever the searcher, Sandrah. We will go on as we must and eventually find those answers.~
@668  = ~If the elves want their Lanthorne and our further assistance they will have to answer those questions.~
@669  = ~Even if the elves of Suldanessalar may not be completely innocent in this situation it is Irenicus that has drawn ourselves into it and I cannot but fight him to get back what he took from me.~
@670  = ~So it was Brage who was scaring the pirate Monteelah on the Sword Coast.~
@671  = ~What are you talking about now?~
@672  = ~You mean...we were suspecting all during this mysterious hunt by Monteelah that some third party was involved. Brage?~
@673  = ~You remember those missing final pieces from the Sharkta Fai papers? We did not know then whether they were taken from the stack or had never been in it from the beginning. Now we know, it was this book that Brage obtained from a pirate, probably one escaped from the pirate's crew. In all his desperate attempts to cure his state of mind he must have found someone who translated it for him.~
@674  = ~Like Shauhana told us, he came here to finally find a cure - or death.~
@675  = ~(While everyone in your party seems to be happy about the ending of the Sharkta Fai adventure, Sandrah has remained silent for quite a while.)~
@676  = ~There are still a lot of open questions, Sandrah, even if today we can celebrate Shauhana's restoration. Is there something that worries you especially, my love?~
@677  = ~(You remain silent and take Sandrah's hand with a smile. She knows you are always there to talk to if she feels the need for it.)~
@678  = ~It is a happy day and it feels wonderful that we have been able to help our new half-orc friend...~
@679  = ~But still...? ~
@680  = ~Oh, it has nothing to do with Shauhana and her healing. That is indeed wonderful. It is more the creature, this Guardian, and his assigned duty as well as the mysterious hints he gave about the godchilds that worries me.~
@681  = ~What about that Guardian, Sandrah?~
@682  = ~(She stops and turns to you.) <CHARNAME>, you know about my believes and motivation by now - and you know that I do not believe in an afterlife and *Other World* at all. Consequently a creature like the Guardian should not exist. Or, to be more precicse, his duty to guard the *portal* is something that I cannot believe in.~
@683  = ~Hm, we have been there ourselves, Sandrah! Shauhana has been restored, the Sharkta Fai pool is reality, her orc mentor has been taken by the Guardian. We both have witnessed all of it with our own eyes. Do you think we have been tricked in some way?~
@684  = ~Yes and no.~
@685  = ~I mean, yes, we have witnessed everything you have mentioned, the healing power of that pool, the creature calling himself Guardian, the disappearing of the dead priest's body. We also know from our research that all of that is very old and mentioned in the oldest documents found on Toril. But that is all, such are the facts we have seen.~
@686  = ~You mean, we have not seen the portal itself and we have no evidence as to where the shaman's body really disappeared?~
@687  = ~You do not accept what we have seen as a proof for the Other World?~
@688  = ~Exactly. What we have in addition is the knowledge of the Guardian about your heritage and an additional hint that Shauhana somehow has a similar origin.~
@689  = ~So again one puzzle starts where another one just has been finished.~
@690  = ~No, the shaman's body may have been transferred to about everywhere, there was not a trace of that so-called *Portal*. What we have found out in addition is the knowledge of the Guardian about your heritage and an additional hint that Shauhana somehow has a similar origin.~
@691  = ~(Sandrah has stood long over the remains of the defeated lich. You could swear you have seen your fearless counsellor shudder for a moment.)~
@692  = ~(You kindly lay your arm around her.) You seem to be worried by whatever you have found, my love.~
@693  = ~Those liches were terrible, I hope there won't be more of that type around here.~
@694  = ~You heard what I heard, I suppose. That Vennegrat and those second rate apprentice liches were referring to the *master*. The large scale *production* of undead, the talk of us, respectively our remains, as material...~
@695  = ~(You look questioningly at her - you have never seen her so desperate.)~
@696  = ~Let us act quickly, <CHARNAME>, this may otherwise mean the end for Shauhana and the Clan Orcs.~
@697  = ~Before we do anything I insist that you share your assumptions with us. We must know what is going on here.~
@698  = ~Well, we did what we could for them. We will not sacrifice our lives for unwashed stupid orcs - Clan or no Clan.~
@699  = ~(It seems she has not even heard your words.)~
@700  = ~Let us go back to the graveyard, please. I want to check one thing before I share my assumptions - and my nightmares - with you. (The smile she attempts is meant to be reassuring but you see that it is really forced.)~
@701  = ~Yes, let us go, there is nothing to be learned here any more.~
@702  = ~(Sandrah has taken out her sketchbook and starts to draw always scanning the surrounding in between. You are sure she will not try to capture the gloom of the landscape at the graveyard.)~
@703  = ~(You move behind her and see that she is sketching a map).~
@704  = ~(She wordlessly pulls you down to your knees so you can both examine her map now.)~
@705  = ~See, we are here...up here the orc village...the crossroads leading to Sharkta Fai...this mountain ridge you see over there...~
@706  = ~(She leans a bit forward to get another view of the inside of that open grave. Then she draws an arrow from that point to show the direction of the tunnel visible below.)~
@707  = ~I think I see the same, Sandrah. Forgetting all these cliffs, glaciers and valleys on the surface, this tunnel leads directly to...Sharkta Fai.~
@708  = ~If my calculation is right, the cave is just on the opposite slope of those mountains. If the tunnels go in a straight line it would be just a four hour walking distance between here and the mysterious pool.~
@709  = ~So Sharkta Fai and those emerging undead are connected!~
@710  = ~And in between them is this strange *factory*?~
@711  = ~They are connected and in between lies a factory producing undead, yes. Remember how we and the orcs were referred to as material.~
@712  = ~The orcs deliver their dead heroes at one end and they emerge as undead on the other end. But what is the purpose of such a transformation?~
@713  = ~None, <CHARNAME>. Those undead are just a by-product, the waste this factory produces. They are what is left when *the master* has taken from the fallen what he really needs...~
@714  = ~Ha, and he lets that fool Vennegrat use his leftovers to start a war that will produce more dead heroes - more *material*.~
@715  = ~Let us go to Shauhana. We need something from her to enter Sharkta Fai. We must stop this *master*.~
@716  = ~You know who it is, don't you?...ah, there comes the next wave.~
@717  = ~I am glad you acted cool headed, <CHARNAME>. Violence helps us little against Szass Tam the way he currently assimilates the Dark Energy.~
@718  = ~Do you see a way to cut him off from his supplies?~
@719  = ~We must destroy these outlets that provide the kernel with a new boost regularly.~
@720  = ~I see no way to destroy them - yet if we could block the way from the outlets to the middle somehow...~
@721  = ~What could probably block the energy boosts - they traverse our bodies, shields and armor without a trace?~
@722  = ~Shall we build a wall now around the kernel, we have no material at hand down here? ~
@723  = ~The energy stops at the rocky walls around...~
@724  = ~See here, <CHARNAME>! The rocks themselves are not penetrated by the flow. Massive stone material stops it.~
@725  = ~If we pile up some boulders in front of each it cannot get on to the middle, I guess.~
@726  = ~There's a lot of boulders on those filthy duergar outside, we must transport some inside of here and build a barricade.~
@727  = ~Don't you have a spell to tear down the roof on this guy?~
@728  = ~(Sandrah with a pale face lets her deadly hammer fall to the ground. Slowly her tense face relaxes and she throws her arms around you.) ~
@729  = ~Have you truly returned to be yourself, <CHARNAME>? Has Bhaal's avatar left?~
@730  = ~That is how it feels? That is what Irenicus wants out of me and Imoen? A deadly killing machine?~
@731  = ~I had no control, by the gods, no one was friend or foe - I could have killed you, Sandrah! ~
@732  = ~(Her voice is icy cold) Mystra would have prevented that.~
@733  = ~The hammer? You were determined to strike...had I not been able to recover and stayed that way?~
@734  = ~We would not be here talking to each other. One of us would have to live on with the fact of having killed the most beloved of all.~
@735  = ~If you had done it, you would have freed me from an existence that would not have been me at all. An act of mercy that only the truest friend would be able to perform. You would have done this for me.~
@736  = ~To have killed you and live on with the knowledge of my deed even if I were not responsible of it. Rather I wished you had the strength to prevent this creature from existing on Faerun.~
@737  = ~Yes. (She kisses you and turns away. There is no need for further words.)~
@738  = ~The avatar of Bhaal. Yours is the most powerful that has ever been seen on the primary plane, <CHARNAME>.~
@739  = ~Does that imply I may be the strongest of the Bhaalspawns on Faerun?~
@740  = ~I have the power to follow him and take his vacated throne! All of that is mine!~
@741  = ~If that were true I would be the one that can prevent all the other Bhaalspawns on Faerun to take the throne of Bhaal?~
@742  = ~(She nods silently.)~
@743  = ~If that were true I would be the one that can prevent all the other Bhaalspawns on Faerun to take the throne of Bhaal??~
@744  = ~(Her voice is icy cold) Mystra will prevent that, just as before.~
@745  = ~As before...as a priestess of Mystra set out to defeat the God of Murder...you would do the same, Sandrah?~
@746  = ~That throne has to be left vacated, <CHARNAME>, or, at least not be used the same as it was before.~
@747  = ~That sounds like the throne may be taken by the last surviving spawn to become a god himself but turn this power into something different than murder?~
@748  = ~As the most powerful of the spawns and given I survive all rivals i could reject to take the role fate has foreseen for me? And stay...me.~
@749  = ~(Sandrah with a pale face lets her deadly hammer fall to the ground. Slowly her tense face relaxes and she picks up her weapon ready for the next foe.) ~
@750  = ~(You nod. Something tells you she was really prepared to slaughter the avatar if necessary.)~
@751  = ~(You nod. You will seek her counselling once you are out of this imminent danger.)~
@752  = ~Now you have encountered yourself what so many who are after you seek to find. Bhaalspawn. ~
@753  = ~Suldanessalar, that is why none of the elves I asked knew Irenicus and Bodhi.~
@754  = ~What is that?~
@755  = ~The hidden town of the elves? Do you think they come from there?~
@756  = ~It becomes clearer now for me, <CHARNAME>. All of this around here is the machinery of an enormous revenge.~
@757  = ~Of Irenicus? But against whom?~
@758  = ~Against Ellesime, the queen of the elves in Suldanessalar.~
@759  = ~You remember when you told me about Jon's bright blue eyes behind the mask of your torturer? The eyes of an elf. He and Bodhi must have committed a crime larger than any against their own folk. They have not been sentenced to death but to an even more severe punishment - to live on in their current state...~
@760  = ~Me and Imoen and the souls they have stolen from us are to be their tools of revenge against an elvish town then?~
@761  = ~Exactly. If we only had the means to warn those elves. But the town has vanished from the knowledge and the surface of Toril some time ago. I can only imagine now that it had to do with the events that led to the exile of our opponents.~
@762  = ~Well, if all of that is true, the only way to help the elves is to pursue Jon. Which we must do any how for Imoen's and my own sake.~
@763  = ~We must follow the two creatures that stole Imoen's and my souls. If that leads us to the target of their revenge...fine, we can surely need those elves to our assistance.~
@764  = ~Before we continue we maybe should return to the inside and search Irenicus' quarters there for additional hints on his further plans.~
@765  = ~Fine. A valid proposal and it will not delay us too much.~
@766  = ~Nope. It will delay us too much and we already know what to do.~
@767  = ~There is a great new danger for us now, <CHARNAME>, unlike any we had to face in the past.~
@768  = ~Ah, Irenicus may be powerful but we have already spoilt his plans more than once. And Bodhi? We have fought great vampires in the past.~
@769  = ~With you by my side and our loyal companions as well - what is there to fear?~
@770  = ~You and talking like that. Has my counsellor and main fighter suddenly discovered the word *fear* in her tome, hahaha?~
@771  = ~What are you talking about now, Sandrah?~
@772  = ~I refer to a danger that is different from any other as we cannot fight it with weapons or spells but just with our will - your will. The enemy inside.~
@773  = ~(Tell her of your slayer's dream.)~
@774  = ~Well, I have discovered this strange new ability. Like in the past when I found new skills after a strange dream at night.~
@775  = ~This is what I mean, <CHARNAME>. You had controlled Bhaal with your will and the goodness of your soul so far. Now Irenicus has taken something from you and left a void. A space that the Bhaalpower will try to occupy - if we do not prevent it.~
@776  = ~How do WE prevent that? It is inside of ME?~
@777  = ~Sadly enough that is true. It is you that is alone with it at the moment of decision. No one can take that from you. All my love can provide to you is to give you the necessary strength and confidence you need. All I can do is love you.~
@778  = ~That is so much, nothing else is needed.~
@779  = ~That and a bit of good advice on the side.~
@780  = ~I must not use the ability come what may.~
@781  = ~Oh, stop that litany. It is my will and my will alone that matters here.~
@782  = ~That is true. Whatever comes for us, do not use the power again. It will only grow stronger until nothing can control it any more. Let it starve on your negligence.~
@783  = ~Just the warm welcome we had to expect in this place - even worse in our pursuit of Irenicus and Bodhi.~
@784  = ~How can it be that they are in alliance with the Drow?~
@785  = ~Why do the drow not treat those elves with the same hostility?~
@786  = ~A common interest, <CHARNAME>, one that make the worst of opponents to allies all of a sudden.~
@787  = ~We have learned already that our foe are most likely elves who have committed a crime against Suldanessalar and its queen Ellesime. They have been exiled from their former home and been punished with the loss of their elven longevity.~
@788  = ~They have stolen Imoen's and my souls to compensate for that.~
@789  = ~Absolutely correct. With that regained power their goal is now revenge on their former hometown.~
@790  = ~The ones that share this deadly hatred for the surface elves can be found down here in abundance.~
@791  = ~Those traitors use the drow against their own folk!!~
@792  = ~With the same logic this makes the elves of Suldanessalar our allies in our fight against Irenicus and Bodhi.~
@793  = ~First we must get out of these caves to notify them.~
@794  = ~A doubtful ally from a town that hides itself to all non-elves.~
@795  = ~<CHARNAME>, not to question your leadership...but we are now drow and facing other drow on their terrain...~
@796  = ~...my counsellor has some advice for me?~
@797  = ~Even if male drow can gain some position within their society it is a rare case for very clever and persistent fighters only. Maybe we would draw a bit less of unwanted attention if one of our females would pose as our group leader while we are here.~
@798  = ~Well...it's a rare case for a male to lead down here - Veldrin of Ched Nassad is such a man...Thanks for the hint anyway.~
@799  = ~Veldrin of Ched Nassad is such a man, just in case you doubt it. Never question my leadership again, my love. Accept your place in this party.~
@800  = ~How about Yasraena, she is even a drow by nature?~
@801  = ~How about Viconia, she is even a drow by nature?~
@802  = ~How about Imoen, she has proven her strength in her time alone in Spellhold?~
@803  = ~How about Amber, disguises are a thief's second nature?~
@804  = ~How about Kiyone, she takes on duties just naturally?~
@805  = ~How about Jaheira, our *secret leader* anyway?  ~
@806  = ~How about Aerie, a chance to improve her self-assurance?~
@807  = ~How about Kim, disguises are a thief's second nature?~
@808  = ~How about Saerileth, our *secret leader* anyway?  ~
@809  = ~How about Nalia, the perfect role for a born noble anyway?  ~
@810  = ~How about Chloe, the perfect role for a half-god anyway?  ~
@811  = ~How about Shauhana, the perfect role for a future orc-queen?  ~
@812  = ~How about Ariena, the perfect role for one as blood-thirsty as a drow?  ~
@813  = ~How about Sheena, the perfect role for one who changes personality at will?  ~
@814  = ~How about yourself - a counsellor should easily adopt to the leading role as well?~
@815  = ~I follow you with all my loyalty and you know that. I am not claiming leadership, I was just advising you how to improve our drow charade.~
@816  = ~Fine, I'm sorry if I sounded harsh.~
@817  = ~I hope I made myself clear.~
@818  = ~Whatever, let's move on.~
@819  = ~Mind that she was raised more as a male herself and despises the drow's ways.~
@820  = ~Good point. Then you just have to accept the role - for the time.~
@821  = ~Still she will do it better than anyone else.~
@822  = ~Mind that she is an outcast and may be still wanted by Lolth's disciples. We should rather keep her hidden than expose her.~
@823  = ~Mind that she may get us in a mess with her talkative ways. Her words slip a bit to easy out of her mouth for such a disguise.~
@824  = ~A brilliant idea, she will love to *boss* you around a bit.~
@825  = ~On second thoughts, why not you - you just have to accept the role - for the time.~
@826  = ~Hm, a risky time for such training - she might easily give us away by being just too kind to you and other drow male.~
@827  = ~A brilliant idea, just make it clear to her that a drow female does not provide charity to the weak.~
@828  = ~Mind that her urge to fight might get us more attention than we require for our mission.~
@829  = ~(Laughs) A dangerous choice, my dear. You know what drow female require most from their love-slaves.~
@830  = ~(Wink) That was exactly why I asked you for it.~
@831  = ~Ha, between the sheets I will still lead.~
@832  = ~Fine with me as long as you allow me to maintain enough strength to pursuit our quest.~
@833  = ~We can use our new privileges gained from the mother matron to improve some things down here during our brief stay.~
@834  = ~What do you suggest, counsellor? ~
@835  = ~The tavern should give us bargain prices by now. ~
@836  = ~We can check out what those *experienced* drow lovers can do for us. ~
@837  = ~We should still keep our profile as low as possible.~
@838  = ~Just north of the tavern were those slave cages. Our status and our useless money will buy the freedom for those poor captives.~
@839  = ~We cannot load ourselves with the responsibility for those exhausted slaves - our own position here is instable enough.~
@840  = ~I respect your attitude towards slavery but those creatures will have no chance to survive more than some hours on their own. And we cannot protect them with the mission we have to perform.~
@841  = ~I fully agree with your analysis, <CHARNAME>.~
@842  = ~But?...I know there is a *but*.~
@843  = ~Solaufein mentioned Eilistraee when we saved him. I am sure there are followers of the Dark Maiden in Ust Natha who will help them back to the surface. All we need to do is get them out of the cages.~
@844  = ~Please.~
@845  = ~If it is just that...I trust you know what you are doing.~
@846  = ~I am sorry for my error, <CHARNAME>, I have endangered you and our comrades unnecessarily.~
@847  = ~A strange reaction, Sandrah, you could not have foreseen that they would attack so senselessly.~
@848  = ~It appears that according to their codex someone had to pay with his life for the theft - and Saemon Havarian was not available.~
@849  = ~He had any reason not to be here. I wonder if that idiot knew what he was hiding.~
@850  = ~Saemon, we will find you! This is not over yet.~
@851  = ~I guess he simply misused us and our abilities to get rid of those pursuers.~
@852  = ~If so we will surely see him again. He will appear to retrieve the blade sooner or later.~
@853  = ~A warm welcome is guaranteed for him. Warm?...No,hot!~
@854  = ~(As you lay down a shimmering dark naked body glides onto the sheet beside you.)~
@855  = ~Who are...Sandrah?~
@856  = ~(Slapp) Male, did you not learn to use your mouth better on me than with talk? (She lightly slapps your behind to motivate you.)~
@857  = ~The mistress will not be disappointed.~
@858  = ~You play your role very well, harsh mistress.~
@859  = ~(Slapp) Last warning.~
@860  = ~(The night that follows is one you will not easily forget. Sandrah really does not hold back the *dark side* of her passion and thus brings you to let out the beast that slumbers beneath your civilised behaviour in the daytime.)~
@861  = ~I cannot resist this inviting dark skin, <CHARNAME>, how will it taste? (She bites your naked breast - *ouch* - just to have an excuse to soothe it again with her kisses.)~
@862  = ~Aaah, this dragon transformed more than just our skin colour. Let me feel what a drow mistress would feel from her love slave.~
@863  = ~Yes...bite me, mistress, teach your love slave her lesson.~
@864  = ~(Willingly your girl friend adopts the role you assigned her with ever new attacks on the sensitive spots on your body.)~
@865  = ~(Slapp) Slave, did you not learn to use your mouth better on me than with talk? (She lightly slaps your behind to motivate you.)~
@866  = ~This transformation surely has its advantage as well. (She kisses you passionately).~
@867  = ~I would not reject another night like this.~
@868  = ~I only hope our quests will not require us to change into a fiery salamander next time.~
@869  = ~The drow have at least this compensation for the live they otherwise have to endure.~
@870  = ~I can see no reason why our normal skin should prevent us from enjoying ourselves like this again. (She gently bites your earlobe.)~
@871  = ~We can burn the sheets together any time without that transformation, my sweet volcano.~
@872  = ~Do you have the same feeling, <CHARNAME>, someone is using us as pawns in a game here - the game being a drow intrigue of course.~
@873  = ~Just because we are send to fight some Underdark gnomes?~
@874  = ~Us and Solaufein as well, I guess, but who and why? ~
@875  = ~This Phaere surely has some plans with us. Wait and see.~
@876  = ~These errands she sends us to do - and always with Solaufein - she just tests our abilities.~
@877  = ~For the bigger purpose she has in mind, I guess.~
@878  = ~ Surely. She does not even care to hide her ambitions to succeed her dead mother at the head of her house and of Ust Natha.~
@879  = ~I thought her mother is still alive?~
@880  = ~Her mother is still in the way of her ambitions then.~
@881  = ~You say it, *still*. Not a great issue in a drow society, especially not for one like Phaere. But she surely cannot acquaint a large fellowship inside the town without the Matron noticing it. So a group of outsiders comes in handy, I guess, provided they prove themselves capable.~
@882  = ~We can do little against this being used, can we?~
@883  = ~I do not want us to get involved in such an internal affair. What can we do, counsellor? Maybe warn the Matron and get her trust this way?~
@884  = ~Not a very good idea, <CHARNAME>. Why should she listen to suspicious outsiders trying to compromise her favourite daughter?~
@885  = ~Knowing the situation we can take our advantage from it. They prepare for war with the surface elves and at the same time they steer towards an internal power struggle. It is a dangerous game but if we play it carefully it may work for our goals. A city in turmoil may serve our purpose well.~
@886  = ~By the way, we should pay attention to Solaufein. He serves Phaere only as long as he must but my assessment is that he will take his chance out of her claws as soon as he sees his chance.~
@887  = ~You like that dark fighter - and lover - don't you?~
@888  = ~(Laughs) If my dark mistress allows me. But maybe you like him as well. As we are not drow females, we might let the male make his own choice I suppose.~
@889  = ~He is trained to accept our commands so he will serve the one he's assigned to...But, no, I do not want a pet but a man who really wants me.~
@890  = ~I have no interest in him at all.~
@891  = ~Interesting - even at the risk that he may not choose any of us.~
@892  = ~He is an interesting man, yes. But I am not drow, just in case you forgot, so I do not command males to my service. It will be his choice - and yours.~
@893  = ~Oh, thank you, *Mistress*.~
@894  = ~I will *convince* him to make the right *choice* should he cast his dark eyes on you.~
@895  = ~Let's see if he can handle that amount of freedom.~
@896  = ~The time for the small errands is over. This time that witch really wants to know it.~
@897  = ~I had not anticipated that turn of events. What does my counsellor propose?~
@898  = ~This is then the end of that arrogant fool. I am not unhappy about that, I confess.~
@899  = ~The drow method to get rid of a rival. And we even advance further in the appreciation of the Matron and her daughter.~
@900  = ~The question of whom of us he would chose is answered in an unexpected way - none.~
@901  = ~Last time it was a helmet, this time it's a coat - provided we can convince Solaufein to hand it to us without a fight.~
@902  = ~Good to hear that, <CHARNAME>, and a good moment to tell you how much I love you.~
@903  = ~Solaufein is a threat even to one who thinks of herself as the next Matron Mother. She does not dare to act against him herself. And we have no reason to kill him or to help her. All she requires of us is a coat and our secret will be save.~
@904  = ~I hope we can convince Solaufein to hand it to us without a fight.~
@905  = ~Will it really be so easy. What if Solaufein is found alive afterwards?~
@906  = ~<CHARNAME>, stop your childish jealousy immediately. Listen, Solaufein is a threat even to one who thinks of herself as the next Matron Mother. She does not dare to act against him herself. And we have no reason to kill him or to help her. All she requires of us is a coat and...~
@907  = ~...and?~
@908  = ~A man like him who has acted such openly again a female like Phaere down here must have seen this coming sooner or later. I should be very wrong if he had not planned an escape.~
@909  = ~Mmh. I have listened to what you had to say, Sandrah. Now listen to me - it will not work. It's either him or us.~
@910  = ~I hope we can convince Solaufein to hand what is needed to us without a fight.~
@911  = ~The drow have a good reason to have the strongest female rule their fate, <CHARNAME>. Think well about the next step you will take before you regret it infinitely.~
@912  = ~(The stony black face Sandrah displays tells you more than a thousand words.)~
@913  = ~Sandrah...(In vain - she has turned away and no longer listens to you.)~
@914  = ~Now you are really ignorant, little boy. Of course she wants you.~
@915  = ~Hm, I'm a grown up man enough to see what this drow beauty has...~
@916  = ~...anything I do not have?~
@917  = ~Hey, who's a jealous little girl now? (You kiss her to settle the case.)~
@918  = ~And what about your own intentions with Solaufein, he?~
@919  = ~The joke's on you, who's a jealous little girl now, hahaha?~
@920  = ~Since when have you become such a doom sayer, Sandrah?~
@921  = ~Finally Phaere will reveal to us why she really wants us and what her plot is. If all my analysis of the facts is correct, this will be our big chance to end this adventure gloriously.~
@922  = ~She still wants more than Solaufein's death?~
@923  = ~Let me know what my counsellor thinks about it and compare it to my own guesses.~
@924  = ~It's all obvious for me as well, we need not to waste more time with talking. ~
@925  = ~The eggs of the silver dragon are part of a ritual to get House Despana the absolute power over Ust Natha. Hence the closing of the city gates by now. We must prevent the success of that ritual under all circumstances as the eggs are our key out of here and to follow the path Irenicus and Bodhi have taken.~
@926  = ~And Phaere and her ambitions work for us. ~
@927  = ~That's how I see it as well, Sandrah, the two most powerful females of the city both want that power and both want to rule the leading house? Do you think Phaere will ask me to kill her mother for her?~
@928  = ~Not in such a direct way as by means of murder. As her mother guards the eggs that are the key issue here, I would rather assume she needs us to change the foreseen course of the ritual in a way that destroys the Matron and puts herself in the place.~
@929  = ~But how?~
@930  = ~It is useless to make guesses as we will surely hear from her own lips in a few moments. I just wanted to recommend to you to agree to whatever she asks of you. Open objection will not help us - we should rather fuel the power struggle between mother and daughter. We cannot defend them both and the city that is behind them, but we can probably deal with the remainder once they have clashed. Even the winner afterwards will have been weakened enough so we can deal with her.~
@931  = ~Fine...did I already tell you how beautiful you are, drow lady? But I think it's necessary you change back soon as your mind starts to work like theirs, my counsellor. (Smile)~
@932  = ~(She is the steady beacon in this journey through light and darkness. Your step lightens as you approach her.) <CHARNAME>?~
@933  = ~I need a sign of your love right here and now, Sandrah.~
@934  = ~Are you hungry, my darling?~
@935  = ~I so wish to see some light again soon.~
@936  = ~Say, my counsellor, can you tell me something about Purskul?~
@937  = ~If what we think about our aiding Mystra and AO to defend the Weave is correct, then...~
@938  = ~(You clear your throat several times before your voice seems to return.) Sandrah, about Saerileth's attack...~
@939  = ~What did your grandmother, I mean, your goddess refer to when she said your role is the *seeker*.~
@940  = ~Did the information we received on the self-writing book help you some?~
@941  = ~Shall we continue our analysis of our discoveries at the Archive?~
@942  = ~It must be a heavy burden that you feel with our discovery in the Archive. Do you know what it really means for us?~
@943  = ~Why had Bhaal chosen Khalindra for one of his spawns if not for the reasons we had anticipated until recently?~
@944  = ~Who is Qilue Veladorn, Sandrah?~
@945  = ~My healer, what can you do to help these people?~
@946  = ~Well, looks like we are ready to go to Legencase now.~
@947  = ~Sandrah, I must talk to you about Saerileth, please.~
@948  = ~An interesting man...~
@949  = ~Yes, he comes into my bedroll now and then.~
@950  = ~That is all?~
@951  = ~That is all - we have some mutual fun together but none of us would call this a romance.~
@952  = ~Little bitch.~
@953  = ~I need not to know more.~
@954  = ~You won't get me jealous with such minor affairs.~
@955  = ~As a healer Sheina provides all that can be done for the suffering villagers. I would be more helpful to assist you in finding the source of that disease and try to get into that cursed castle with you.~
@956  = ~I am glad you say that, Sandrah.~
@957  = ~As I said earlier, I do not see it as an urgent task for us, rather something we may investigate when *your* quest allows it.~
@958  = ~How about doing it in our trusted way - that is put all the facts we have in front of us and see if our combined genius can reveal us something?~
@959  = ~I will come back to the issue another time then.~
@960  = ~If it is really a *book* in our standard terms it will be as old as any of the Gods .~
@961  = ~It was mentioned that it is in a sacred place, so I guess it would be in a temple.~
@962  = ~A temple of one of the gods that were from the beginning.~
@963  = ~Probably not Mystra as we would know about that by now.~
@964  = ~Tyr is as old as one can imagine.~
@965  = ~How about Selune, she is one of the oldest deities?~
@966  = ~Someone like Amaunator, ancient but forgotten today.~
@967  = ~How about Tymora who was from the beginning?~
@968  = ~We probably can exempt the evil Gods like Bane or Talos.~
@969  = ~I agree with you. Let us see who the other candidates are.~
@970  = ~Should we seek a book on all crimes ever done and the justice applied I would agree - but bloodlines? Let us see if their is a more likely candidate.~
@971  = ~I cannot see such a task within her nightly domain, even if she is also associated with prophesy. Let us see if their is a more likely candidate.~
@972  = ~(Smiles) We surely need some good fortune to find that book, but I think she is not the one. Let us see if their is a more likely candidate.~
@973  = ~They would rather destroy such knowledge than to preserve it. Let us look at the  more likely candidates.~
@974  = ~I declare you Genius!! Once again you have proven it  - or once again you blindly hit the right spot.~
@975  = ~Thank you, but why do you think it's him?~
@976  = ~The mighty ancient sun god, you know his domain was such that several gods were needed to succeed him.~
@977  = ~Helm and Lathander...~
@978  = ~*...not Oghma but one who was before...*. Amaunator was the bringer of light to Faerun, but also in the sense that he brought light for the mortal strive for truth and wisdom and such preceded Oghma and Deneir.~
@979  = ~We know where we need to search, I guess.~
@980  = ~We found his old temples already but no sign of such a book in any.~
@981  = ~I need to study my lore again - now that I have a trace of what to look for.~
@982  = ~My role is to find the one who will succeed her in the line of incarnations of Mystra one day.~
@983  = ~It sounds like her own reign will not be that long any more...I mean for a goddess...if a successor has to be found during your own human lifespan.~
@984  = ~Have you any idea - despite that strange self-writing book - of how to go about that task?~
@985  = ~Mystra has maintained a lot of her human aspects from the time she was Midnight. My feelings tell me that she has always seen her role as Guardian of the Weave as an interim - both for the celestial as for herself. She agreed to AO when need was after the incident that killed Mystra in the Time of Troubles to serve to maintain the balance - until her real successor was found - or will be ready to accept her task. ~
@986  = ~You mean...there is a kind of deal between your grandmother and AO for her to guard the Weave until the real new Mystra would be ready for her task. One that was born at the Time of Troubles but could not yet become the goddess when the unforeseen death of the old Mystra occured?~
@987  = ~(Smiles) I thank you for bringing some clarity into my own confused thoughts. Your theory at least aligns with all the facts we have found so far. There was a moment when I was misled to think that what happened to me where tests of my own abilities. Now I see clearer. Somehow my grandmother's agreement with AO seems to forbid that she addresses that woman to become Mystra herself.~
@988  = ~So her trusted priestess and granddaughter needs to do that for her. What will you do?~
@989  = ~So her trusted priestess and granddaughter needs to do that for her. Will you leave me then to follow your own quest or do you invite me come with you?~
@990  = ~So her trusted priestess and granddaughter needs to do that for her. But how, as you have sworn to follow me and my quest already?~
@991  = ~(She embraces you tenderly and gives you a warm kiss before she continues.) One thing this seeker has found already is - YOU. Not only the love I have found in you, <CHARNAME>, but also the fact that your fate and mine have always been one since the day we have met.~
@992  = ~The answer I must find, the woman I must find, it is the quest of a lifetime and I must not rush.~
@993  = ~You hope to find some clue during our time together? ~
@994  = ~What we surely can do is to investigate about that strange self-writing book at several locations we will hit anyway.~
@995  = ~The only trail I know of at the moment is the bloodline of Mystra that is recorded in that *Book which Writes Itself.* If we come by an Temple of Oghma or maybe Mystra's Temple at Waterdeep we could investigate there about that book. Another possibility would be the Bloomwhiffler Bookshop or even my father.~
@996  = ~Well, fine, we will just do that.~
@997  = ~I am so very happy that your task and mine will not separate us...I could never had let you go.~
@998  = ~Irenicus chose that dagger among all your possessions to keep it for himself. It appeared to me that it must have some significance for his studies.~
@999  = ~You saw it as a key to my mother's identity.~
@1000 = ~HE saw it as a key to your mother's identity. Why he should have an interest in her I do not know - but it appears he knew not more about her than we know.~
@1001 = ~But all WE know is that the dagger belonged to a female Bhaalist and that Gorion might have known that woman.~
@1002 = ~As I'm a child of Bhaal it is obvious that I'm of interest to those remaining Bhaalists. This *A* may have been one sent after me.~
@1003 = ~*A* is not *K* - like in Khalindra. You always had your doubts that our mother is really the same, right?~
@1004 = ~Gorion laid out hints to your past for you in digestible bits. He may not have told you the whole truth about that woman in his letter back at Candlekeep, have you considered that?~
@1005 = ~Do you accuse Gorion of a lie now?~
@1006 = ~If his letter were a lie he must have had his reason for it.~
@1007 = ~I am not calling your stepfather a liar. However it may be possible that he tried to make the revelation about your *father* more bearable by giving you an acceptable mother in return. His intention may have been to give you enough strength to continue your quest.~
@1008 = ~Which means we know as much about my mother once again than we did before - nothing. Until we find Gorion's dagger once again.~
@1009 = ~Sarevok and Gorion's dagger - an unexpected relation.~
@1010 = ~After all I'm glad to have it back.~
@1011 = ~We have a common heritage, remember that.~
@1012 = ~If there is any hidden meaning to that, I miss it.~
@1013 = ~He said something interesting even if it was not related to the dagger.~
@1014 = ~If his words were true, it means that the essence of a dead Bhaalspawn in some way returns to the Realm of your *father*.~
@1015 = ~Following the trace of the dagger provides us with information - maybe that was Gorion's intention with it.~
@1016 = ~Gorion, Sarevok, the dagger, and *A* - somehow there is a connection between all of them and me. ~
@1017 = ~You seem concerned, <CHARNAME>, but, yes, this is not a trivial task we have in our responsibility.~
@1018 = ~I was pondering something else, Sandrah, with all those hints and bloodline relations...I mean what if we fail? What if Mystra is defeated like in our vision?~
@1019 = ~If even the gods set their trust in us, we should not fail. Let us move on.~
@1020 = ~You had something else on your mind. Let me hear it, please.~
@1021 = ~It is about your role...should we fail.~
@1022 = ~It was too absurd what came to my mind. Please forget it, I would just make a fool of myself otherwise. (You kiss her quickly, knowing she just *pretends* to believe you.)~
@1023 = ~The Weave would be without a guardian then. I doubt that it can be controlled by any sorcerer regardless how powerful. But worse things would happen, <CHARNAME>. Without Mystra in control the other gods would attempt to each claim their stake on the power source - especially the *evil* gods. A new power struggle would commence.~
@1024 = ~The return of the *Time of Troubles*.~
@1025 = ~AO could only prevent that by appointing a successor for Mystra.~
@1026 = ~Again our knowledge of history is comforting here, as that has happened in the past as well. There would be a solution this time again. Of course, like in the past, it would not be an easy one.~
@1027 = ~Especially not for one who comes from the bloodline from which the incarnations of Mystra have been chosen in the past. One who receives constant indications that she follows her grandmother's path...~
@1028 = ~I have to stop you here, <CHARNAME>. Whatever you may assume, do not forget that my relation to Mystra is through Elminster and the line of Mystra is from MOTHER to daughter...But I cannot completely ignore all the evidence that points to my involvement. ~
@1029 = ~Maybe it is my role to find the one who will follow my grandmother as Mystra. To find her and to help her succeed to her role.~
@1030 = ~Hm, if it cannot be you...the candidates should be in this *Book that Writes Itself* .~
@1031 = ~I have the strong feeling that we miss one crucial link in our reasoning here. We are too blind to see something that maybe is too obvious.~
@1032 = ~What if Elminster was your mo...oh, no, maybe Khalindra was...ah, it's all confusion, I am just babbling, forget it..~
@1033 = ~(At first it seems she will start to laugh - but her expression changes quickly to a grave one.) Yes?~
@1034 = ~You were not really in danger - I mean with your skills...she had no real chance to harm you?~
@1035 = ~You stopped it right in time before any of you could really be harmed. I admire your self-control.~
@1036 = ~When you fought back - did you even think for an instance of killing her?~
@1037 = ~(She remains silent for a painful while.)~
@1038 = ~Well - I do not feel very comfortable with your question as any answer I may give you can be interpreted as coming from a jealous girl trying to disparage her rival...~
@1039 = ~Be assured that will not be the case. I really care for your feelings in this matter...you were the attacked here, even if the attempt was nothing but a farce.~
@1040 = ~Your self-righteous baby paladin really intended to kill me. Forget about my feelings, <CHARNAME>, so many want our lives these days. Rather ask yourself what it tells you about her.~
@1041 = ~I know what you mean...but I forgive her, she is still so young and she never had a chance to learn about life other than from her paladin teachers. In our company she will learn that there is so much more than just black and white.~
@1042 = ~I have asked myself the same questions already. She must learn to accept that her strict views from here paradise homeplane cannot be applied to the life on Toril.~
@1043 = ~You know that I love you, more than anything else and I stand by your side through thick and thin. But, please, I cannot be your counsellor in your relation to other women. You must decide and follow your heart alone.~
@1044 = ~You are right - I should never have brought the topic up. (You kiss her passionately.)~
@1045 = ~I love you, too. (You kiss her tenderly.)~
@1046 = ~If any proof were required for your love you have just given it to me again, light of my life. (You embrace her and hide your face in her locks that smell of spring flowers today. She tenderly motions your head up so she can kiss you.)~
@1047 = ~She seems to explode almost of pride and happiness. You must have fulfilled her deepest wish.~
@1048 = ~Eh, actually...not yet.~
@1049 = ~(Sandrah bursts into unstoppable laughter until tears come to her eyes.) Oh, my...she has you on the hook, hehehehe,...Men!...(She shakes her head and burst into laughter again).~
@1050 = ~This should have been a serious talk about our future, my dear. Can you stop making a joke out of it!~
@1051 = ~I have expected all kinds of reactions from you but not this!~
@1052 = ~How can I not laugh when the greatest hero of the Realms tumbles into the child paladin's marriage trap like a blind schoolboy? Am I right, my love? She wants to be yours - but only when she holds the deed of ownership in her little hands - sealed by the priest of Tyr that is.~
@1053 = ~I understand that you are not utterly happy about that - but do you need to paint her as cunning as that?~
@1054 = ~You make it sound like I am a fool for my decision. It is true love that deserves such a price.~
@1055 = ~You are right, I should rather admire her for the clearness and directness of her goals and how she achieves them.~
@1056 = ~Not every one can be as complicated as you are, my sweet seeker. Your goal was never marriage - maybe you do not even know yet what your own goal is.~
@1057 = ~At least your laughter shows that I have not hurt your feelings with my decision.~
@1058 = ~You are right. I should not belittle your decision - actually I accept it like it is. If you are willing to pay her price there is nothing for me to criticize. My problem will be to find the right present for your great day - oh, and the right dress... (Another attack of laughter drowns her words.)~
@1059 = ~Neither you nor me are among those who should marry. Anyway you have made your decision, so be it.~
@1060 = ~It changes nothing between you and me, <CHARNAME>. I do not know where we will finally end - but I know and I have sworn to it that our way to whatever is a common one. I will be by your side as I have been all the time. And I will love you.~
@1061 = ~(You wordlessly kiss her.)~
@1062 = ~I hope my future wife will understand that. She must. I love you, Sandrah.~
@1063 = ~Nothing will ever change what is between us, Sandrah. (You embrace and kiss her.)~
@1064 = ~Look, there is that paladin girl Saerileth again. She seems to be still looking for help.~
@1065 = ~Where? We might help her this time.~
@1066 = ~Ah, but we have no room for her in the party right now.~
@1067 = ~Oh, no, not again! I need no bigoted paladin at my side.~
@1068 = ~Lucky me, I just have to turn my head and look at you - and I see light and love in the darkest of places.~
@1069 = ~The sound of your voice alone has made this dungeon a lighter place for a moment.~
@1070 = ~Hungry for a lunch of kisses - your kisses.~
@1071 = ~I am never satiated when it comes to love - your love that is.~
@1072 = ~My whole body craves for you, beloved. Let us get away from other eyes immediately, hmmm.~
@1073 = ~(You move her to a nearby place hidden from inquisitive eyes...)~
@1074 = ~There is only one solution then.~
@1075 = ~(She leans towards you and blows a kiss in your ear) There are so many things I would like to do with you and in so many places. (Laughs) I cannot make up my mind at this moment.~
@1076 = ~Then you surely will not object to what I do to you now...~
@1077 = ~Expect the unexpected.~
@1078 = ~Qilue Veladorn, or Eresseae Qilue Silverhand, is the youngest of the Seven Sisters, a daughter of an earlier incarnation of Mystra herself. Some legends have it that her mortal avatar is drow, but probably that is just anecdote because she became the High Priestess of Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden.~
@1079 = ~I see. I thought by mistake that she may be more closely related to you.~
@1080 = ~She is considered as one of the Chosen of Mystra, just like my father is - even if their respective mothers are different ones with only their later rise to godhood in common.~
@1081 = ~Still, she is as well from Mystra's bloodline and also one of my major influences besides Midnight.~
@1082 = ~I can imagine that. She left the place beside her godly father to become a beacon for the drow who would wish to return one day from the Underdark. A great task to make our plane a better one.~
@1083 = ~You chose your heroines quite well and without restrictions to race or tennant. Like them you seem to know what you want Toril to be.~
@1084 = ~Qilue Veladorn, or Eresseae Qilue Silverhand, is the youngest of the Seven Sisters, a daughter of an earlier incarnation of Mystra herself. Some legends have it that her mortal avatar was drow, but probably that is just anecdote because she became the High Priestess of Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden.~
@1085 = ~I see. That means that your mother as well was a descendant of Mystra, not only your father.~
@1086 = ~(During the short mystical travel Sandrah has changed into a silvery diaphanous gown that clings to every part of her wonderful body. As the light breeze of the Sword Coast embraces your body you realise that you are completely nude yourself.)~
@1087 = ~(You move up to her and your naked skin is attracted by her gown like by some magnetism. You feel her hands on your shoulder and your behind pulling you even closer to her.)~
@1088 = ~(She slowly sinks to her knees pulling you down with her. You find your head directly between her soft breasts and only need to open your lips to grasps a protruding nipple and feel the arousal in both of your bodies building up higher...)~
@1089 = ~....~
@1090 = ~.....~
@1091 = ~...yes...YES...~
@1092 = ~...aaah...~
@1093 = ~...mmh...~
@1094 = ~...I love you...~
@1095 = ~(When your eyes steady you see a wonderful white deer standing in front of you but facing away to the sea. Suddenly the creature turns her head and the sparkling eyes that look at you are very familiar.)~
@1096 = ~(Only now you realise your own metamorphosis - you are a roebuck of stately stature.)~
@1097 = ~(The white deer wiggles her short tail invitingly and moves a bit away from you.)~
@1098 = ~(You have no control of your *hoofs* as you follow her, nor can you object the intense animalistic desire that steers your body to hers.)~
@1099 = ~(You feel her silken fur against your stomach as you jump with your forelegs onto her delicate back.) ~
@1100 = ~(Your strong hind legs move rhythmical as you penetrate her without hindrance or hesitation.)~
@1101 = ~(A small snort like sound is all you receive from her but that is enough to indicate that you give her exactly what she needs.)~
@1102 = ~(The violence of your climax lets your animal body shudder and you glide exhausted from her back.)~
@1103 = ~(When the blur from your eyes is gone you see Sandrah standing in front of you with a smile.) I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1104 = ~*Snort* (Hey, I need my voice back.)~
@1105 = ~(Sandrah has her mighty tome on her knees and studies certain pages intensely.)~
@1106 = ~(You adore her silently. In her concentrated reading she represents for you the beauty that can lie in knowledge. Actually, if your comparison was right knowledge was one of the most beautiful things imaginable.)~
@1107 = ~Are you making some progress in your search for the mysterious book?~
@1108 = ~With our idea of an Amaunator temple to be the residence of the Book that Writes Itself we were on the right track.~
@1109 = ~Please let me know your findings.~
@1110 = ~It is written here, that each Amaunator temple had an area only accessible to the priests that was called *The archive*. Sounds like a place were records and such are kept, does it not?~
@1111 = ~Good and bad news, I guess. The one in the Umar Temple probably was destroyed by the Shadow Dragon. His lair would have been that archive before he moved in violently.~
@1112 = ~Amaunator's temples are only ruins nowadays...~
@1113 = ~Again you probably are right, my lovely genius, please go on.~
@1114 = ~The temple below Athkatla was more or less intact, even if the worshippers of the forgotten god had no idea what they were preserving. Unless there is another temple that we have not even found yet I would propose to give this one a try.~
@1115 = ~The only alternative we know so far is below Athkatla, but we have explored that one already. Either we need to look again with our current knowledge of what might be there or it is in another temple that we have not even found yet.~
@1116 = ~The one below Athkatla holds no secrets for us any more, so - dead end until we find another installation during our travels.~
@1117 = ~It would not take us too far off from our quest to check the one below the Temple District once again with our enhanced knowledge. If it is not the one we can at least eliminate it from the list of possibilities.~
@1118 = ~I have no objections. ~
@1119 = ~There is no need to hurry but we can probably find some time for the short excursion.~
@1120 = ~Time will tell. Maybe we will find the missing temple some day.~
@1121 = ~(You feel Sandrah's hand glide into yours, a sign that at other times fills you with hope and strength - this time it seems that she is in need of your support.)~
@1122 = ~(You squeeze her hand reassuringly, trying to show that you understand and care for her. She surely needs a bit of time to fully understand what she has learned in the Archive.)~
@1123 = ~Yes, I am here for you to talk and to listen when you are ready for it. I love you.~
@1124 = ~I love you forever, <CHARNAME>. (She continues to walk beside you hand in hand, silently but relaxing more and more with each step.)~
@1125 = ~In the end it will mean what I decide to make out of it - sorry, what WE make out of it, <CHARNAME>. You know best what a heritage of that sort means and you also know that in the end it it ourselves who shape what we become.~
@1126 = ~You have certainly contemplated about the revelation same as I did. Let us sit down together and see if we share the view so far.~
@1127 = ~You are wonderful, again and again. Yes, let us recapitulate what we have learned - to express it in our own words will let our minds grab the meaning and impact of it all.~
@1128 = ~Up to now we have always seen in you Midnight's granddaughter through your father's line. Now we have learned about a similar but even more significant connection to Mystra through your mother's bloodline.~
@1129 = ~As it seems you are the only remaining mortal on Faerun who can continue Mystra's bloodline and succeed the goddess yourself or through your daughters, should you ever have them.~
@1130 = ~Please, let us not jump to conclusions just now. In our proven manner let us put piece beside piece so we do not oversee any important detail.~
@1131 = ~Fine. For the moment I suggest to forget about anything we knew before of your heritage and your grandmother and focus on the motherly line.~
@1132 = ~We never believed it to be by accident but rather by Bhaal's evil plan. Now I think, that we have just erred in his motivation to implant a Bhaalspawn into Khalindra. It was more than just revenge on Midnight and her son - but I will come to that later.~
@1133 = ~So the facts. My mother never had shown any magical skills or interests, nothing that made any connection to Mystra apparent.~
@1134 = ~But still her bloodline is one of most ancient on the primary plane and through Qilue Veladorn reaches back directly to Mystra. (Smile) Maybe that explains your knack for drow companions and some of your skills in the bedchamber.~
@1135 = ~Oh, my, silly. Even if Qilue Veladorn really was drow - which I doubt - it would be almost one hundred and ten generations between her and me. I have as much elvish or orc blood within me than drow, which is about the same mixture you will find in any of us if you just take enough generations into account.~
@1136 = ~But jokes aside, I have to accept that I descended from Mystra both through my father and my mother.~
@1137 = ~This is the first part of what we learned. I propose to continue another time to deal with the consequences this has when we add the rest of our findings to it.~
@1138 = ~This is the first part of what we learned. Now let us look at the consequences this has when we add the rest of our findings to it.~
@1139 = ~This is when I asked the Book about the other descendent of Mystra in my belief that I was the one assigned to find the successor of Midnight in her role as Goddess of All Magic.~
@1140 = ~Well you found her, didn't you?~
@1141 = ~This remains to be seen, <CHARNAME>. Much can happen and I always denied that our fate is written without our having a say in it and the possibilities to shape it.~
@1142 = ~Back to the facts. We were told that in the generation before us there were two descendants of Mystra left. The book did not tell us the names because they had been delivered before - but we know who they were - Midnight and Khalindra.~
@1143 = ~One a priestess of the goddess herself, well aware of her duties, her heritage and courageous enough to pick up a fight even with gods. The other a merchant's daughter, beautiful, young and intelligent winning many hearts but seemingly unaware of the blood she carried. Thus was the situation when unexpectedly Mystra was killed in the Time of Troubles and AO had to urgently find a new guardian for the Weave.~
@1144 = ~Combine those two personalities and we get - you!~
@1145 = ~(Blushes) Oh, charmer. How can we work earnestly if you come up with such. At least there is a grain of truth in your words. Midnight's line ended when she gave birth to Elminster and afterwards ascended to Mystra. But still the two remaining bloodlines were united as Elminster without knowing this fact fell in love with Khalindra.~
@1146 = ~And you are the result of that love and that union and the only one of Mystra's bloodline who is left.~
@1147 = ~A fact that destroyed my mother as it was known to another god as well - Bhaal.~
@1148 = ~You already allured to the fact that I was sired with Khalindra for a different reason than we had assumed until now?~
@1149 = ~You already allured to the fact that the Bhaalspawn was sired with Khalindra for a different reason than we had assumed until now?~
@1150 = ~His plan was more than mere revenge - but in which way?~
@1151 = ~We have completely lost our sense of time over the topic. Let us continue this on another occasion.~
@1152 = ~Not just any spawn, but one of the strongest, one to grow from the essence of the weaker ones and become a major power and maybe even aspiring to the Throne of Bhaal. ~
@1153 = ~By the time Bhaal was seeding his spawns he knew how the Time of Troubles would end - for him but also for the ones who would bring him down. And even if the final backstab was done by Cyric - and Mask was involved as the deadly weapon - it was Midnight who had lead and concluded the mission in AO's name. The priestess of Mystra, later reincarnate as the goddess herself, was the real enemy for the God of Murder.~
@1154 = ~With his plan to live on through his spawns who would grow and each of them hold part of his essence so enough would be maintained to restore his power one day, there was one opponent to be eliminated who could spoil the plan once again - Mystra.~
@1155 = ~When Khalindra died at the Bhaalspawn's birth, the possibility for another daughter from the only remaining bloodline was eliminated. Hm, but you were born already, and a daughter as would be required.~
@1156 = ~When Khalindra died at the Bhaalspawn's birth - my birth, the possibility for another daughter from the only remaining bloodline was eliminated. Hm, but you were born already, and a daughter as would be required.~
@1157 = ~(She hesitates for a moment.) I know you will understand my next words correctly as an innocent baby cannot be blamed for its father's cunning plan. With inseminating Khalindra Bhaal not only prevented the birth of further children from her line - he also placed the killer for the last remaining one right into the same cradle.~
@1158 = ~You are mad! The second child was to be your killer?...oh, Sandrah...No, you are not mad, it's Bhaal who is wicked beyond human reasoning.~
@1159 = ~You are mad! I was to be your killer?...oh, Sandrah...No, you are not mad, it's Bhaal who is wicked beyond human reasoning.~
@1160 = ~The wolf grows up beside the lamb until one day the wolf gets the lust for meat...~
@1161 = ~Only that the lamb was not so sheepish and the good shepherd was watchful enough.~
@1162 = ~So in Bhaal's plan we would grow up as siblings with your full trust in me. But my calling of the blood would commence and grow inside of me until one day I would become aware of who I really am. And my first victim would be the one who would otherwise become my strongest opponent.  Mystra would be dead before she even had an idea who she was.~
@1163 = ~I am glad you do not blame the messenger for the news she brings.~
@1164 = ~So in Bhaal's plan the two would grow up as siblings with your full trust in him or her. But the calling of the blood would commence and grow inside until one day the younger would become aware of its true nature. And the first victim would be the one who would otherwise become the strongest opponent.  Mystra would be dead before she even had an idea who she was.~
@1165 = ~Honestly I do not know the whole truth - yet, <CHARNAME>.~
@1166 = ~In which respect?~
@1167 = ~Sharkta Fai itself and the legends about it are much older than the current misuse by  Szass Tam. The pool and the Watcher must have been there before.~
@1168 = ~You told us that even the Elves and other folk know about that entrance to the other world.~
@1169 = ~You have seen Shauhana's healing with your own eyes there. Not likely to be the work of that hyper lich.~
@1170 = ~The legend is old and Szass Tam is one who has studied every piece of information about necromancy, prolonging ones existence and other related issues thoroughly. I would be astonished if he had not come across the legend at one time or other. You know well that I myself do not believe in it - and Szass Tam has found that out himself, provided he ever believed in it himself...~
@1171 = ~Ha, but he found a good use for it with superstitious orcs that would freely deliver him *material* right to his doorstep.~
@1172 = ~Yes and no. He makes use of the orc's habit and believe as they always have done so - for the watcher. However Szass Tam has a much greater hunger than the watcher ever had.~
@1173 = ~The factory is a perpetuum mobile, a thing I read about in Candlekeep once. It produces undead that he gives to Vennegrat to fight a war that produces new dead heroes for Szass that are turned to new undead...and so on and on...~
@1174 = ~But what about Shauhana's healing?~
@1175 = ~Szass is not the only one to make use of old legends.~
@1176 = ~What?...oh, I see...you did that somehow, didn't you? But how?~
@1177 = ~I will tell you about it when we come to the pool again. It is nothing supernatural or faked, just the knowledge every potent healer should have.~
@1178 = ~Fine. I have learned from you that everything will be revealed in due time. So what about the legend that is so old and widespread?~
@1179 = ~Unless someone disrupts this vicious circle.~
@1180 = ~We know well who that someone is.~
@1181 = ~Fine. I have learned from you that everything will be revealed in due time. ~
@1182 = ~I think I owe you a bit of an explanation about what I found out so far about this place here.~
@1183 = ~You promised to tell me about Shauhana's healing.~
@1184 = ~Sharkta Fai itself and the legends about it are much older than the current misuse by  Szass Tam. The pool and the Watcher must have been there before. You told us that even the Elves and other folk know about that entrance to the other world.~
@1185 = ~(Sandrah grabs deep into the mysterious pool and comes up with a handful of green slimy material. She holds it to your nose and you smell a faint odour like those you know from your healing potions.)~
@1186 = ~What is it?~
@1187 = ~They pour healing stuff inside to produce the effect? ~
@1188 = ~It is an algae which has some healing effects, <CHARNAME>, a bit like a small healing potion. A natural resource and probably the origin to the legends that surround this pool.~
@1189 = ~But is that enough to restore the fallen or to heal a wound like Shauhana's?~
@1190 = ~No, it is just enough to give this pool a special reputation. Priests have done their share to grow a legend out of it and the mysterious watcher has found this place later on as it provided him with the *food* he needed. Until our mighty foe occupied the place and causes the current problem.~
@1191 = ~If the Watcher consumed the fallen orcs, then who...ah, I start to understand...you did...~
@1192 = ~Still Shauhana was restored from the wound you said you could not restore yourself...~
@1193 = ~<CHARNAME>, all higher races on Toril have one thing in common - our body and our mind form a union where one part influences the other. Our mind, the feelings and emotions as well as our beliefs can let our body achieve things it would not be capable alone.~
@1194 = ~Like fear makes us run faster than we otherwise would?~
@1195 = ~A valid example. Now, for a healer that is essential knowledge. Often you lose a patient because he has already given up himself mentally - vice versa you can use the will of the patient to fuel the healing process.~
@1196 = ~In Shauhana's case the various ingredients came together, the water of the pool, her will to become hale and her strong belief in Sharkta Fai - and a healer's knowledge and skill to make use of those ingredients.~
@1197 = ~So in the end it was you - by knowing all of this and being able to use it. Probably that makes you the best healer I have ever encountered.~
@1198 = ~<CHARNAME>, that was the most wonderful compliment you could have made me. My healing skills are the most important value to me. (She kisses you dearly).~
@1199 = ~I propose we prepare ourselves well and rest before we continue into the lair below.~
@1200 = ~Do you know how to accomplish that?~
@1201 = ~The watcher has not appeared this time, what are we going to do?~
@1202 = ~There is no turning back now, I guess. What is our plan?~
@1203 = ~The watcher has not appeared this time as he does not get the scent of the fallen body that usually attracts him - time to use Ghotal's key.~
@1204 = ~Come here, <CHARNAME>, touch that emblem of Myrkul, but only lightly, please.~
@1205 = ~Ouch, it is freezing cold...~
@1206 = ~Exactly, and by this it will open the gate through the pool.~
@1207 = ~Wait, Sandrah, we need to rest and heal before we go on. I will tell you when we are ready to go.~
@1208 = ~(Sandrah cautiously takes Myrkul's emblem in her gloved hand and steps up to the pool.)~
@1209 = ~(As the symbol touches the water, the whole pool freezes within seconds. Sandrah gives all of you a sign to step onto the frozen surface with her...~
@1210 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, you should allow me to transport us to Waterdeep and to talk to Ringhontal at the Temple. They would not send for me if I were not urgently required.~
@1211 = ~I am sorry I let you wait with this. It's good to remind me now, we will go right away.~
@1212 = ~Oh, the mighty Temple of Mystra can surely solve a problem without their little priestess' help for once.~
@1213 = ~I fully understand, my love. There is so much you have to think of and decide. I will prepare the spell now.~
@1214 = ~They would not ask me if that were the case. Remember I serve the Temple exactly for these special purposes and I am granted so much freedom otherwise. It is in our all interest if you now listen to your counsellor in this matter.~
@1215 = ~Look! What is this?~
@1216 = ~(You come closer and see that a part of the ships planks shimmer and blur in a strange blue light. The wall seems almost transparent. This must be where the vampires have come in a moment ago.)~
@1217 = ~A kind of portal between the planes, that is why the former inspections have found no traces on the ship itself. They must come and go through this connection.~
@1218 = ~I guess we best report back to the temple so they can use Mystra's aid to seal it.~
@1219 = ~As long as it is accessible from yonder it will be a threat to Waterdeep and beyond. I see no way other than to pay those creatures a visit at their home base.~
@1220 = ~<CHARNAME>, you have Mystra's representative standing already right beside you. All they would tell us at the temple is that this here is my mission and duty - and send us back to here again.~
@1221 = ~I see. Well, there is no way than to let you go ahead at your discretion.~
@1222 = ~Your reputation as a leader is well deserved, my love. Even I must confess I adore you for it.~
@1223 = ~With a counsellor like yourself at my side that is easy. But say, what is our option to return once we enter to wherever this may lead us?~
@1224 = ~If they can use it to visit us we can use the same way to return.~
@1225 = ~Fine, onwards then.~
@1226 = ~Fine. Let us just heal and restore everybody before we move on.~
@1227 = ~Onwards.~
@1228 = ~Now, my love, I propose to go to the Temple to bring them the news. I anticipate that the priests will perform some cleansing on the *Harare* to prevent any further use of that portal.~
@1229 = ~Probably the temple will also be the right place to preserve or destroy this strange crystal that made the dimension fold possible.~
@1230 = ~Thank you, my love, of course I will do my best to assist you in this. First of all let me say I am quite content that you accepted the sphere to our responsibility.~
@1231 = ~Even if we have to cooperate with the damned cowls for it?~
@1232 = ~The cowled wizards are part of the fragile balance that keeps Athkatla peaceful for the time being and as such even Mystra accepts their actions although their use of her gifts are far from being what they should be. The sphere in their hands would give them too much power as it would to any other user. You correctly spoke of responsibility. This is what it will mean for us.~
@1233 = ~It's a powerful thing, isn't it? And very dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands?~
@1234 = ~I do not see much use in it for our goals, even if it's a powerful stronghold.~
@1235 = ~Even if we have no direct use for it ourselves I would declare our party as its guardian in Mystra's name. We have seen what damage it can cause in the hands of such as the Necromancer Lavok and I do not expect the cowled wizards to use it for the wealth of all in Amn. It is here and it has made its final voyage I think. We cannot destroy it and we cannot remove it. So my counsel to you is that we defend it against all that want it as a tool to gain power.~
@1236 = ~Fine. I will play along the lines of Teos and his buddies. This way we know what's going on and we control them as much as they observe us.~
@1237 = ~Sounds like it will be cumbersome but necessary.~
@1238 = ~Just a final word of warning, <CHARNAME>. The sphere is like a beacon for those who attempt to gain power through the misuse of magic. It will attract them like a candle attracts moths.~
@1239 = ~Ha, and like moths they will burn their wings when they provoke our combined forces.~
@1240 = ~I am glad you accepted Eleanor Ybgir's quest. I am saying that on behalf of my goddess and everybody who has a glimpse of an idea what this mage is seeking to do.~
@1241 = ~Do you know this Khaddyr by any chance?~
@1242 = ~Can you give me any details about this thing called permatration?~
@1243 = ~I observed how you tried to keep calm in Eleanor's presence. You are REALLY concerned by that mysterious threat?~
@1244 = ~I neither know that mage Khaddyr nor is now the time to bother you with details about the ritual he is obviously attempting. Even if our elven lady erred deeply about Mystra's involvement with permatration, one thing remains true - it is the sacrifice of many for the sake of one power hungry miscreant. Mystra and me will not allow such a deed. The example of Karsus remains a warning for all ages.~
@1245 = ~It's enough for me to have your agreement even if I see that the story of everything that may be involved here may be quite long - given the time that has passed since Karsus' fall.~
@1246 = ~As much as I would like to correct some misinterpretation of Mystra's role here, especially by the Helmits, it is rather time to act than to talk...my hero.~
@1247 = ~As much as I would like to correct some misinterpretation of Mystra's role here, especially by the Helmits, it is rather time to act than to talk...my heroine.~
@1248 = ~More than before I am convinced we are obliged to solve Eleanor Ybgir's quest. In a city like this it should be possible to gather the parts for that proposed forged crown.~
@1249 = ~Without her help what will we do with the parts?~
@1250 = ~I've seen that murderous mage with my own eyes now - He needs to be stopped. Only how? ~
@1251 = ~Our old friend in the docks should be able to help us with his skills if we bring him the ingredients that Eleanor has listed for us.~
@1252 = ~Ah, Cromwell! I should have thought of him myself.~
@1253 = ~You're right, Cromwell should be able to put together such an item from the things we bring to him.~
@1254 = ~We are indeed in Athkatla in Amn, <CHARNAME>, very much beneath the centre of town. I followed the Shadow Thieves from the merchant's promenade into this dungeon to find you.~
@1255 = ~You come from outside, Lady? But strange, how come the Shadow Thieves attack this prison, I thought they are in league with our capturers? ~
@1256 = ~Yes and no. My friends were taken here by one group of Shadow Thieves while another group today assaulted this place. As far as I can tell from the little information I could secretly gather, there are different guildes of the thieves operating here, as well as other strange creatures at war with both sides. It is really confusing.~
@1257 = ~You did well to operate most secretly, my lady. The Shadow Thieves, regardless which guild, are no fun to deal with.~
@1258 = ~GROWWWLLL~
@1259 = ~(A wave of enourmous anger and power seems to emerge from Pelligram as she sees the misused creatures surrounding the beastmaster.)~
@1260 = ~What an addition to my menagerie would that cat be. Fights like you have never seen before would make us rich.~
@1261 = ~You will see only one of those fights, slaver, right here and now, and I doubt you will enjoy it.~
@1262 = ~What? Damned intruders!~
@1263 = ~(The telepathic message that Pelligram seems to send out to her fellow being is so strong that it appears to you as if her mighty voice explodes right in your brain.)~
@1264 = ~Fear nothing, Tabitha, the day of freedom for you has come.~
@1265 = ~Your game play is useless on us. We have found the evidence on your companion - your dead companion - that you slavers follow your business right here under the eyes of Athkatla's temples.~
@1266 = ~Our dead...you killed the captain...ha, that's why the *ware* has not arrived yet, hear that, Ketta?~
@1267 = ~You idiot! Now you have revealed it to that little cleric girl...Dontcha see she was just fishing in the dark with her accusation.~
@1268 = ~I can confirm to you, that your so-called *ware* will not arrive at all. The well has been dried by us. Same as this installation will be in just a few minutes.~
@1269 = ~Ho, ho! How bold! Ketta, shall we?~
@1270 = ~Of course, my dear. We should try not to make as much of a mess as with that guard.~
@1271 = ~(Whispers) Try to hear him out for any detail we may learn, <CHARNAME>, but do not say yes or no yet to his proposals. The Shadow Thieves may not be the single option to find Imoen. Let us not decide until we know about the others.~
@1272 = ~Ah, the secret little advisor I heard so many reports about already.~
@1273 = ~And a beauty who could steal away any thief's heart with ease. I can only hope we will get acquainted a bit better over time...(sigh.)~
@1274 = ~And another beauty who could steal away any thief's heart with ease. How could one possibly make a choice here...(sigh.)~
@1275 = ~(Smiles) If you really knew a bit about my reputation then you would be aware that I do not reject someone because of his profession, mmh.~
@1276 = ~Psst...this is to our benefit in two ways, <CHARNAME> - we get close insights into the shadow thieves' operations and at the same time we can control the activities of at least a number of them.~
@1277 = ~Oh, my, this reminds me of Noober or Roober. Say, your name is by chance *Floober*?~
@1278 = ~What? Haha, I am Neeber.~
@1279 = ~And you have a widespread family?~
@1280 = ~Wow, you met cousins Noober and Roober already...WAIT! You're that hammer girl...oh my...please, not the fountain...~
@1281 = ~Sir Keldorn! Ajantis' Mentor?~
@1282 = ~The very same, my lady. You have met...oh this glance in your eye when you speak his name, you must be...~
@1283 = ~Sandrah of Waterdeep, my lord. A strange place to meet - but probably not for a paladin and a priestess of Mystra. Anyway, I am delighted to make your acquaintance finally. Ajantis mentioned your name and your deeds often.~
@1284 = ~The pleasure is mine, lady Sandrah, as Ajantis' letters were full of praise of your intelligence and your courageous deeds - and of course your loveliness and beauty, which I can only confirm right now.~
@1285 = ~But where is Ajantis right now, his reports have ceased to come for a while?~
@1286 = ~(Sighs) I had dearly hoped that you could tell us. He had to leave us on the Sword Coast for a mission in Helm's name and we have not received news from him since then.~
@1287 = ~You did not? Strange enough. We should look into that once we have got out of this dungeon here successfully.~
@1288 = ~The very same, milady. You have met...oh this glance in your eye when you speak his name, you must be...~
@1289 = ~Then you must be Sir Keldorn! Ajantis' Mentor?~
@1290 = ~Still the old grumbler and tyrant, Uncle Hurgis. The little Sandrah was always so afraid of you when you came to Waterdeep to see mummy and daddy.~
@1291 = ~Who...oh..yes, little Sandrah of Waterdeep has become quite a lady, not to be recognised that easy. But now tell that stubborn paladin who I am to speed things up here.~
@1292 = ~Oh, yes I will. (Whispers) That man has never seen me before nor do I know him, <CHARNAME>, this is a trick to get Tyrianna from our care.~
@1293 = ~I will get her now, please excuse my precaution, my lord.~
@1294 = ~It's obviously a trap and you are not Hurgis.~
@1295 = ~You must be mistaken, milady, but I have neither acquaintances at Waterdeep nor do I know a girl named Sandrah. Now, please, no further disturbances in this business.~
@1296 = ~Thank you for this confirmation, my lord, but please understand that we need to be careful. That man has never seen me before nor do I know him, <CHARNAME>, he tells the truth. An imposter would surely have declared to remember me.~
@1297 = ~Even if I can understand your caution I hope we can end these tests by now. Time is pressing.~
@1298 = ~If we would not know it better, <CHARNAME>, I would swear this sounds like our good old wildcat Shar-Teel. What do you think?~
@1299 = ~Shar-Teel! You know this crazy bloodthirsty wench? I will not say any more words to you, you must all be a bunch of madmen yourself. Let me outa here...~
@1300 = ~Vile wizard! You enslave not only imps but also people? Take his offer, <CHARNAME>, and let the poor man free. But you, mageling, your next spell attempt shall be a transportation directly to the Nine Hells.~
@1301 = ~A priestess of Mystra...I heard you are able to bestow Mystra's curses on magic users you find not adequate to your goddess' recommendations. Did you just curse me, girl?~
@1302 = ~You will find out if you ever try to use Mystra's gifts again. (Her face is stony as she turns away from Mekrath.)~
@1303 = ~A bird shall be free to sing and never be anyone's slave. You will not be kept by bounds to us that you do not accept yourself.~
@1304 = ~Words of utmost delight from the lips of a girl who can only be a dream, too wonderful to be real - both the words and the girl.~
@1305 = ~Come back to reality, wordy poet. Yes you must be a poet of sorts, a bard maybe?~
@1306 = ~Your bard from now on, milady, bound by voluntary slavery to a mistress so kind and ...wait, what is that?~
@1307 = ~You are one not bound by the chains of this plane yourself! How come we have never met before?~
@1308 = ~What are you talking about, my confused bard? I am of this plane, a human who has never left Toril except in her dreams.~
@1309 = ~Can it be? You are and you are not. Or maybe not yet. Your bird must nest close to your heart to find that out...~
@1310 = ~How did the theft of Gorion's dagger help you in your plan?~
@1311 = ~(Laughs harshly) Is that really all that puzzles you at such a moment, priestess?~
@1312 = ~It is the only question we are not able to answer by ourselves today, your other actions are quite transparent in their shrouded ways.~
@1313 = ~Whoever you are, girl, you don't bluff me. There is much more you don't know and I'm afraid you will never have a chance to find out anyway. But...why not...it will not hurt to tell you...~
@1314 = ~I cannot assume that you know anything about <CHARNAME>'s mother since you don't even know anything about <PRO_HISHER> or Imoen's FATHER.~
@1315 = ~Thank you for this information, Irenicus. I think we share the same assumption, even if I do not yet see why <CHARNAME>'s mother would interest you. The dagger is the key to her identity but you have not resolved the issue.~
@1316 = ~(Irenicus looks perplexed for a moment.) Ah, so YOU knew about Bhaal already, your interest is to this particular Bhaalspawn's mother. Why?~
@1317 = ~It is not your concern, Irenicus, you have not the information I seek, so much is obvious.~
@1318 = ~Nor have you - and you will never find it as you will go down with <CHARNAME>.~
@1319 = ~There may be some objection against such an attempted theft, Solaufein.~
@1320 = ~I should have guessed that one as powerful as you claims Veldrin as her own. Guard him well, priestess, but do not forget that Ust Natha is not your town (yet).~
@1321 = ~Hm, I have observed your fight and victory, priestess, but heed this warning - whoever you are in Ched Nasad, here it is my house who rules and takes what they want. ~
@1322 = ~(You cannot but notice the slight uncertainty in Phaere's voice and the questioning look she gives Sandrah. A glance at Solaufein assures you that he observed the same.)~
@1323 = ~Let me be open to you, Solaufein, even at the risk that it is a mistake. We do not have the intention to become Phaere's marionettes ourselves.~
@1324 = ~I note your words, priestess, even as I choose not to comment on them now.~
@1325 = ~Neither would you relay them to your *mistress* - do not say a word, I trust you will not. You have no reason to trust us yet but maybe our action in this case will convince you of our true nature.~
@1326 = ~Whoever you are in Ched Nasad and why you came to our city, you impress me each time anew. You risk a lot but you are not foolish, you seem to have the power to back up your plan. But I will not wiggle free of one bondage to exchange it with the next one, mind that. For the case at hand - all you are required to do is bring back some artefact to the witch that makes her believe you did the deed.~
@1327 = ~You, priestess, wait! Is that the one you were talking about, silly girl?~
@1328 = ~She has shown more than once that she is far superior to this Veldrin she pretends to follow, mother.~
@1329 = ~At least to this assessment I can for once agree, daughter. I can sense her power clearly.~
@1330 = ~For the time I have use for you and your party, priestess, but you are under close observation all the time. Ust Natha is OUR city - forget that for one single moment and Lolth will be upon you - do you understand?~
@1331 = ~Matron Mother, I seek not the fight with you, but do not speak for the Spider Queen if you are not really sure you are her favourite.~
@1332 = ~(Hiss) We will see. Tumble once and be sure House Despana will give you the push into the spider pits. Now be off.~
@1333 = ~Did you really expect this to work with us, Jarlaxle.~
@1334 = ~Sweetest priestess - yes, yes, I see through your disguise - even more alluring in your drow incarnation, why must we always meet under the worst of circumstances?~
@1335 = ~Your choice of men...mh, mh, the loser Drizzt, or this male caricature <CHARNAME>...~
@1336 = ~Your choice of bed mates...mh, mh, the loser Drizzt, or now even a female like <CHARNAME>...~
@1337 = ~ENOUGH! My choice would surely not let me pick a lowly drow bandit and stupid murderer.~
@1338 = ~Your anger only enhances your beauty - and stirs up my lust. I was to let you all depart here as part of my good will and fairness. But now my price has increased - there will be only one way to leave this pocket plane. After a night with you, proud priestess, in which you pay the fare for your companions.~
@1339 = ~Or maybe your girlfriend would even like to join us in our pleasures...~
@1340 = ~(Laughs out loud) Drow, you obviously never learn. You would rather spend a night under the whips of two handmaidens of Lolth than to endure my wraith. You have just said goodbye to your life.~
@1341 = ~If that is your last word, you have sentenced your friends and yourself to death.~
@1342 = ~(You feel a small hand slip into yours and you instinctively return a tender squeeze.)~
@1343 = ~(You look at Sandrah and she gives you one of her enigmatic smiles.) ~
@1344 = ~(You take her hand and feel once again the power and confidence she constantly has given you since that day long ago when you had to leave Candlekeep.)~
@1345 = ~(You return her smile as with Sandrah you need no words. You have no more doubt - with her by your side Irenicus will fall.)~
@1346 = ~Derrick? The silent elf ranger, who used to watch and never talk?~
@1347 = ~Sandrah!! The girl who always let me lose every thought I had for every word I might have wanted to tell her.~
@1348 = ~You are with friends up here in the woods? You mentioned someone named Valygar.~
@1349 = ~Obviously you don't know him and were not sent to pursuit him.~
@1350 = ~Mmh, I definitely trust you, Sandrah, maybe you and your friends may be able to help someone in trouble with the cowled wizards in Athkatla.~
@1351 = ~They are not our friends, for sure. Actually we can need any ally against them.~
@1352 = ~My friend is in his cabin nearby. (Laughs) Maybe he has more success with you, Sandrah, even if he rarely uses more words than I did.~
@1353 = ~Let me heal your wounds *quickest* - at least those on your body.~
@1354 = ~Oh, besta friend, I wish you could heal it all and make me myself again but I kinda guess my case is even beyond your skills.~
@1355 = ~You are not one to give up yourself and I am not one to give up a patient in need, Imoen. If we travel together again we will find a way to help you and <CHARNAME> and make it all end well...If we travel together again...(She looks at you and it is clear which decision she expects from you now.)~
@1356 = ~<CHARNAME>, your equipment has been taken, probably by those greedy Duergar. With my magic parcel I may be able to retrieve some of our valuable items, if you want me to. ~
@1357 = ~Maybe those greedy Duergar have laid their hands on Mommy!~
@1358 = ~Looks like our capturer has kidnapped others as well. You grieve for your lost Mommy then?~
@1359 = ~We must find my Mommy. The Master has hidden her in a box. ~
@1360 = ~A box?...I see...An assassin would refer to her favourite weapon as *Mommy*.~
@1361 = ~Thanks for reminding me of that. We will have a lot to talk about later. For now our task is to get out of here quickly.~
@1362 = ~(The ground seems to shake below you, you look at Sandrah for an explanation.) ~
@1363 = ~GRROOOWWL!~
@1364 = ~I see. She hates that Leopard being caged and exposed like that.~
@1365 = ~I hope you do not get us in trouble with those cowled wizards, Pelligram.~
@1366 = ~Purr. (Pelligram rubs her nose at Sandrah's leg and seems to be utterly satisfied with her deed.)~
@1367 = ~Pelligram, that was an unsanctioned use of magic within the city limits. (Laughs) Wonder if those cowls really want to incarcerate her for that. But one never knows, mind you, <CHARNAME>, magic use without their approval is strictly forbidden in Athkatla.~
@1368 = ~What was that? Did Pelligram do that?~
@1369 = ~Use of magic os forbidden here. Is that why they took Imoen with them?~
@1370 = ~You know that she is a companion of Mystra to accompany me on my way. I found her in a cage like that to be trained for the arena and pit fights. (Smiles) Although I now think, that was just a charade of my goddess for me to find and free her.~
@1371 = ~The cowled wizards control all use of magic here in the city. To use those powers without penalty you need to get their approval. Like everything in a city like this, you can get that probably through bribe. We just need to find the right person for that.~
@1372 = ~Thank you for your trust, <CHARNAME>. Pose your questions, watcher.~
@1373 = ~It is the morning, oh seeker of light. What is your first task?~
@1374 = ~I will start the day with a prayer to the light.~
@1375 = ~I will then hold the holy book to the light so it will be blessed.~
@1376 = ~I will afterwards meditate on the glory of the light that defeats the darkness.~
@1377 = ~ So ends the morning ritual, child.~
@1378 = ~The sun is now high in the sky. The time for the noon ritual has come. What will be your action to praise your Lord, child?~
@1379 = ~I will recite a hymn in praise of Amaunator.~
@1380 = ~I will continue my praise by raising my hands to the sun.~
@1381 = ~I will finally enjoy the dominance of the sun at its highest point.~
@1382 = ~Darkness is nearing and it will be time for the evening ritual to be performed to ward off the evil. What will you do?~
@1383 = ~I will recite the rules of the faith first.~
@1384 = ~Then I will hold my children high for them to see the setting sun.~
@1385 = ~I continue with mourning the fact that the sun temporarily has to withdraw from the assault of the darkness.~
@1386 = ~So ends the evening ritual.~
@1387 = ~I am once again impressed by your knowledge, Sandrah.~
@1388 = ~Males! YOU WILL DROP YOUR WEAPONS IMMEDIATELY! <CHARNAME>, stand back! Solaufein, come here!~
@1389 = ~Priestess, I told you already I will not exchange one of you for another tyrant.~
@1390 = ~My interest in you is not such, Solaufein, you have nothing to fear of me. I will only give you one order and you will not regret to follow it.~
@1391 = ~<CHARNAME>? Mh, I guess that's *Veldrin's* real name - a rare name for a *drow*. May I ask yours too, priestess?~
@1392 = ~Sandrah, and that surely is no drow name. But it is a name that stands for keeping the promises I give to anyone.~
@1393 = ~(Laughs harshly) You have played your role well, Sandrah, as Phaere and her mother take you as a Matron from Ched Nasad in disguise. What is it you want down here, surfacers?~
@1394 = ~The same that you want - to get out of here and maybe even prevent the war between two brother races.~
@1395 = ~Brother races? Do you really know what you are talking about?~
@1396 = ~There are drow whom I call my friends, Solaufein. You are not afraid of Lolth as are those drow who follow Eilistraee and dream of the two races to unite again one day.~
@1397 = ~You impress me once again, Sandrah, just as before already. So what is the one order you want to give me?~
@1398 = ~Give us your Piwafwi.~
@1399 = ~What? That is all.~
@1400 = ~The coat is what Phaere requires as proof for your death.~
@1401 = ~<CHARNAME>, he has found ways already in the past to re-emerge by some foolish magician's aid. We can only find out if we bite into this hook - knowing it is another of his traps.~
@1402 = ~I see you are acquainted with Jarlaxle, milady. Make out of it what you want, my offer stands and I know nothing more but what I told you already.~
@1403 = ~Right, Sandrah, we must take the risk in order to find out. Man, go on but make it quick and avoid trying to fool us.~
@1404 = ~You make a claim on that Veldrin, priestess. Mind that you walk on thin ice here in Ust Natha. You will regret it if you try to deny him to me. He's not so important that you can't forget or replace him, he?~
@1405 = ~(Her smile looks threatening in her drow appearance.) I have no intention to fight over him with you. I know your type well enough to know you will not be interested in him very long. He will return to me full of useful information and added skills should you really let him close to you.~
@1406 = ~Ah, a loyal male you have. He may not return to you at all when I'm finished with him.~
@1407 = ~You would not be so foolish as not to return him to me unharmed. All of Ust Natha's powers will not protect you from my rage in such a case.~
@1408 = ~By Lolth, who are you to talk to me like that in my own place?~
@1409 = ~I am sure you would not like to find that out the hard way...~
@1410 = ~This monster man will pay for all, besta friend Sandrah, he'll feel your hammer and my fireball, I swear and swear it. But it's good that nothing could part us after all. ~
@1411 = ~Fireballs...? He also did something to my magic skills somehow.~
@1412 = ~Have you met Khalid already on the way you have come, my dearest friend? We were separated and I heard screams but we have not found a trace of him yet.~
@1413 = ~Uuuuaah! Sandrah, they have killed her! Minsc and Boo had to watch and could do nothing when that monster cut our witch with his knifes. Who could do such a thing and why? Uuuuaaah! We must find him and stop him. We owe this to Dynaheir.~
@1414 = ~Wulfgar, son of Beornegar from Icewind Dale. It is a pleasure to meet the famous Sandrah. I have heard already much in favour of you, although my witness' statements , Drizzt's words, may have been a bit tinted by his own feelings for you.~
@1415 = ~You have the flask so we can do the exchange now.~
@1416 = ~I would have done almost anything to get back Gorion's dagger, however you came to know of that!~
@1417 = ~The dagger? I am afraid that is not what I have for you. The dagger you talk about seemed to have some importance for the master himself, he took it with him, I fear. I hope you will find the item I give you of much more value in your present state.~
@1418 = ~Come, Tabitha! Come...open the cages! Aid your master!~
@1419 = ~Mmmpf. Why do we stand around and waste our breath with talk instead of smiting those bastards? And, yes, it's good to have your hammer back again in the group. (His beard hides his smile, but not completely.) ~
@1420 = ~I am Chloe, a kensai of the Yr'kai tribe and I was hired by the Shadow Thieves to assist them in their attack against this dungeon. I am currently a sellsword, so I do not have much background about what happens here. But <CHARNAME> invited me to make it out of here together. (My, is she lovely!)~
@1421 = ~Oh, that priestess? Who is she, a handmaiden or some Matron's daughter who's collar who have to wear? Ah, you cannot tell me any how as her tortures would be even greater than what I can make you fear.~
@1422 = ~Poor one, but I have more urgent things to do at the moment than to start a fight with one like her.~
@1423 = ~I am glad you understand the dilemma. I will suffer even for this precious moment here with you.~
@1424 = ~This knowledge is for some only, for the chosen seekers, lore older than Oghma himself.~
@1425 = ~My companion Sandrah is such a seeker, it is her bloodline she investigates.~
@1426 = ~I see that you may have a valid reason to ask because it is the bloodlines that the book records. Only the book can decide if Sandrah has a right to know or not. Unfortunately I cannot tell you where you can find it. It is not with Oghma but with the one before.~
@1427 = ~I think, my counsellor, this seems to be a task for you and and your never-ending knowledge of lore.~
@1428 = ~No, Solaufein. I was sent here to kill you... time to die, fool.~
@1429 = ~I'm sorry, Solaufein... I have no choice. I have to kill you.~
@1430 = ~Phaere sent me to kill you, Solaufein, but I'm not going to do it.~
@1431 = ~Wait! We don't have to do it!!~
@1432 = ~Let's do it quickly, Solaufein.~
@1433 = ~It's someone even you will respect, Phaere, I have no choice.~
@1434 = ~I will try to do my best, Mother Matron.~
@1435 = ~Forget it, tyrant. I have no intention to aid your course in any way.~
@1436 = ~But Jarlaxle is dead, we have killed him ourselves.~
@1437 = ~Have you ever heard about a book that is called *The Book that Writes Itself*?~
@1438 = ~My companion Sandrah and I have fought the slavers whenever we caught a glimpse of their activities. We will act against them with all our force.~
@1439 = ~My counsellor Sandrah has de-masked the villain who claimed to be Hurgis Baltezan. The child is save.~
@1440 = ~An unexpected opinion from one who is as powerful as you. No one can succeed alone. Friends and lovers form our soul like our heritage and our goals. Bhaalspawns there are many but none I have encountered with such wisdom.~
@1441 = ~<CHARNAME>.~
@1442 = ~I do not need your doubtful gift. My companion Sandrah knows no fear when it comes to destruct what is evil. I trust and rely on my companions as much as I trust myself. She will go ahead for me.~
@1443 = ~This is the Harper's headquarter here in town, isn't it?~
@1444 = ~A mage named Xzar told me.  He wanted to gain entry to the compound and retrieve his companion.~
@1445 = ~Lines of great strength and a long past is what I see in your hand even from here, young priestess...~
@1446 = ~(With an amused smile playing around her lips Sandrah stretches out her hand to the fortune teller.)~
@1447 = ~(Kveroslava, the fortune-teller, takes Sandrah's hand and looks at her palm with the eyes of an expert.)~
@1448 = ~Yours is a future that is related to...powers, great powers...can it be?~
@1449 = ~(Kveroslava suddenly looks from Sandrah to you, her eyes wide with horror.)~
@1450 = ~Powers I cannot see and do not want to see - you will face them, you have no choice.~
@1451 = ~We always have a choice, my-lady, it is us who shape our own fate in the end.~
@1452 = ~(Kveroslava has suddenly calmed down again.) We must be strong to withstand fate. Maybe it is such a strength why your future escapes my sight... keep your coins, please. I... don't have the power to discern the path of one such as you.~
@1453 = ~Another piece of the puzzle, Ellesime...~
@1454 = ~That beautiful elven queen for which Prism died to make her sculpture...your knowledge is confusing as so often, besta friend.~
@1455 = ~An elven queen indeed, Imoen. Another hint to some events in a hidden city of the elves.~
@1456 = ~If ya would've asked me, besta friend, that Irenicus has nothing elvish on 'im, no and no.~
@1457 = ~That beautiful elven queen for which Prism died to make her sculpture...your knowledge is confusing as so often, Sandrah.~
@1458 = ~That Irenicus has nothing elvish on him, if you ask me. From the little I got to see of him, at least not.~
@1459 = ~An elven queen indeed, <CHARNAME>. Another hint to some events in a hidden city of the elves.~
@1460 = ~*She says no more, obviously lost in her thoughts.*~
@1461 = ~Hoy! You'd be the one I's watchin' for, aye? Uncle Gaylan told me to give you a bit o' help to find some work. Listen up, eh!~
@1462 = ~You are a clever boy, Brus. You see and hear a lot, right?~
@1463 = ~Like uncle's not told you da full price you gotta pay fa his service?~
@1464 = ~We should have guessed as much, <CHARNAME>, the shadow thieves give nothing for cheap - except murder.~
@1465 = ~Now, now, calm yaself, lady. Uncle would've told you of the increase bit by bit like another 20,000 on each visit.~
@1466 = ~Until which sum would be reached, do you have an idea, boy?~
@1467 = ~I overheard him and da boss ment'n 150,000, lady...~
@1468 = ~150,000 gold - this will be quite some work to gather it, even in a region like Amn.~
@1469 = ~Don't despair, I have somethin' for ya.~
@1470 = ~Coo! Ye be already above 15,000 and think you're fine. But my masters changed their hearts, you were found to be a much more dangerous client than expected.~
@1471 = ~We know already about the final sum you and your masters were planning to charge us.~
@1472 = ~Coo! I should've known you're none to be fooled, lady. You should be on your way to get the 150,000.~
@1473 = ~Weasel.~
@1474 = ~You will get nothing out of your greed. We will find another way.~
@1475 = ~Coo! I should've known you're none to be fooled, <PRO_LADYLORD>. You should be on your way to get the 150,000.~
@1476 = ~Coo! Ye be already above 130,000 and need go no further. My masters changed their hearts, and they will accept that sum. It is a competitive rate, I think.~
@1477 = ~Yes, I'm ready to pay your price.~
@1478 = ~No, I'm not ready to go just yet. I'll be back.~
@1479 = ~Brus mentioned a new deal. Is that the change he spoke of? ~
@1480 = ~(Mumbles)...and still he may be much closer to you than you would like to admit.~
