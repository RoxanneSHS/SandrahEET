@97   = ~Хватит болтать, займёмся делом.~
@98   = ~This mage's name, Jon Irenicus, I heard it before. He has done more with his magical powers than to punish this crazy loveblind murderess. Something much more evil and destructive.~

@100  = ~Once again your lore exceeds mine by far, I cannot remember to have heard his name ever.~
@101  = ~This plane is full of madmen and demented mages, why would anyone keep a record of their names?~

@103  = ~If he is such a powerful mage and he has really misused his powers like you assume, then whatever he has done must be a crime so enormous, that it is kept secret even among the elves themselves. ~
@104  = ~Can't you use your pretty head to solve OUR problems, counsellor. We have plenty of those. ~
@105  = ~Never mind, <CHARNAME>. It was just curiosity that made me ask, because I had heard the name before and I was astonished to hear it in a place like this. Probably it does not concern us at all. Hopefully he will never cross our path.~
@106  = ~I pray for that. We have plenty of opponents that threaten our lives every day. ~
@107  = ~Another foe shows his ugly face. I am afraid I am largely responsible that the Storm Lord has cast his eyes on us.~
@108  = ~Hm, from your discussion I have learned that anyone of power not following this Lord of destruction would draw his attention sooner or later.~
@109  = ~Puuh - this one is a god and not just a minor one. We are deeper in trouble than I would wish to be - and the timing couldn't be worse.~
@110  = ~Right - with me in the company just a bit sooner than otherwise. If you do not follow his evil and chaotic ways it is hard not to get into trouble with him.~
@111  = ~I hope his chaotic ways will soon draw his attention on something else and away from us.~
@112  = ~I'm not worried, I have you and Mystra on my side - far more reliable than the ever-changing weather.~
@113  = ~Talos, Calos, Balos...celestial fools are, mh, celestial fools not more and not less.~
@114  = ~His interest in you would have come sooner or later, <CHARNAME>, do not fool yourself. Maybe my guidance to a way of living completely opposite to his demands has just accelerated things.~

@116  = ~This symbol, you mean? Do you think those lizards worship him?~
@117  = ~Disturbing the peace of Osprem and Xerbo, trying to imbalance the scales between the creatures of the sea and those who make a living from it? That may well be the hand-writing of my old friend, the Storm Lord.~

@126  = ~(Look at her questioningly.)~
@127  = ~Why does your family come to your mind right now?~
@128  = ~Did I think aloud, <CHARNAME>...? The mad God of Lies is a disturbing person - but let us move on now, this is no place for prolonged stay.~
@129  = ~Yes, let's take this symbol to the Temple in Beregost and report our success there.~
@130  = ~At least his symbol will bring us good coin at the Temple in Beregost. Let's go and report our success there.~

@135  = ~Have you ever heard about that great *Book of Unknowing* back at Candlekeep?~
@136  = ~Hm, not that I know of it. But, wait - (Laugh) - if I understand it correctly, I may have held in in my hand and even read it, but I simply would not know of it, right?~
@137  = ~Misty, misty indeed. I guess that would only happen to true believers in Leira. Us trivial unknowing mortals may have a chance to see it and remember.~
@138  = ~Whatever, Sandrah. It sounds like an interesting subject. My, if we could only get access to Candlekeep again.~
@139  = ~We have a number of reasons to attempt for that, this book being the least of it. The knowledge to be found there is also related to you and Imoen and your heritage and fate.~
@140  = ~Я заметила, что ты ещё раз изучаел детали этого кинжала. Для тебя это что-то особенное, <CHARNAME>?~ ~Я заметила, что ты ещё раз изучаела детали этого кинжала. Для тебя это что-то особенное, <CHARNAME>?~

@147  = ~Хм, в таком случае Горайон сам получил его от кого-то и оставил себе. Дизайн древний, возможно, это предмет, который он сам унаследовал от своих предшественников.~

@152  = ~Why not? You have any new ideas about the thing?~
@153  = ~(She studies the dagger for some time before the responds to you.)~
@154  = ~Nothing too specific, I have to confess, just a few observations.~
@155  = ~By weight and design of the item I would say it was rather designed for a woman than a man.~
@156  = ~Interesting.~
@157  = ~Yes? Go on.~
@158  = ~Cherchez la femme *A*. ~
@159  = ~A trace to my mother maybe?~
@160  = ~As a weapon it has not seen much fighting...~
@161  = ~Gorion was no adventurer as long as I knew him.~
@162  = ~Candlekeep was a peaceful enclosure, I never saw Gorion use a weapon or offensive spell until the day of his death.~
@163  = ~What I meant was, the weapon was not used for fighting even before it came into Gorion's possession. It looks more than a ritual dagger by its original design.~
@164  = ~(She hesitates for a moment.)~
@165  = ~It may just be a silly young girl's imagination, but those ornaments have a sinister impression in my eyes.~
@166  = ~A sinister ritual dagger? Huh, you mean like one used for some kind of sacrifice or such...?~
@167  = ~(She nods without saying a further word.) ~
@168  = ~So finally we found the key to this vampiric sword - no, let me correct myself - we found the sword is the key to a place called the vault.~
@169  = ~Some treasure worth hunting, but the information is still slightly vague, if I may remark.~
@170  = ~*...a small, desolate isle surrounded by raging waters, only to be entered when the waters were calmed...* Hm, an island that can be reached at certain times, meaning it cannot be far out in the ocean. Maybe near the coast and reachable at low tide.~
@171  = ~Or an island in a river. Raging water in the springtime when the snow melts in the mountains but calmed in the warm seasons.~
@172  = ~There are islands like that in the south of the Sword Coast. I remember one or two down there, we killed an army of gibberlings near one of them, can you remember?~
@173  = ~I have no better clue than that, my clever detective. We could check it, if our journeys ever lead us close to the place again.~
@174  = ~So another bit of the Sword Coast history revealed by us.~
@175  = ~Some experience and some gold we have gained, but what else? Is there any insight into our current task?~
@176  = ~I always hated vampires and I found another reason why. But was this discovery really worth it? Is there any connection to our quest that I do not see?~
@177  = ~Ancient vampires that travelled the Coast by these mysterious astral tunnels. The vault seemed to have been their travel centre of kinds. I guess you are right, <CHARNAME>, there is no other insight here for us, than that the past is still alive in many ways around us and reaches out for us sometimes unexpectedly.~
@178  = ~Did we have to do that, <CHARNAME>?~
@179  = ~Sandrah, they have attacked us without any chance to come to some agreement. We just wanted to pass by in peace.~
@180  = ~There was no choice, wasn't it. THEY caused this bloodshed, not we.~
@181  = ~A whole village dead without apparent reason...and you say we are not to blame for this?~
@182  = ~What makes you say such a thing? You were here yourself - you even killed most of them. Are we supposed to feel guilty for defending our lives?~
@183  = ~I feel so...dirty. It is so pointless. Why did we not just run away and took another road. Let those blue bastards alone - we have won nothing.~
@184  = ~I am not proud of what we have done, Sandrah, but look at it this way - we are a strong party and able to defend ourselves. If we had run away and kept them alive, what would have happened to a caravan of harmless travellers that could have met them without warning?~
@185  = ~Oh, don't be silly, my 'counsellor', it is surely not your 'advice' to run away from such blue bastards and let them attack anyone who comes their way.~
@186  = ~I am a bad counsellor today, <CHARNAME>. Of course you are right, they did not give us a chance to act otherwise and we could not have left this threat terrorize the whole area and endanger anyone else who could come along here unaware.~
@187  = ~Maybe it was just the complete stupidity of their senseless attack...why did they not see that we were much too powerful for them? Ah, do not worry, we will not be able to find an answer to that...~
@188  = ~You are right. This battle is not among our heroic deeds, just some dirty job that needed to be done. Let us get out of here before all our morale reaches a new low point.~
@189  = ~(Take her in your arms for comfort.) Let us look for some sunshine even on this dreadful day, shall we?~
@190  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for trying to comfort me - but...I have the feeling we must find out the reason behind that stupid attack. Those Xvarts were not themselves - as if somebody or something had them under their spell. Please, let us take a closer look at this haunted cave, just to make sure we have not missed something crucial.~
@191  = ~Well, it's just a few steps away, if it makes you feel better...let's go.~
@192  = ~All we need now is to get out of here and forget the whole thing over some mugs of beer and a warm bath.~
@193  = ~That arrogant fool, calling himself the *Son of Murder* now openly is making promises to his followers for the time of his *immortality* already.~
@194  = ~There are no more doubts now, counsellor. Our findings and your learned analysis of the facts are proven correct now. Even if I had preferred your error, if you know what I mean.~
@195  = ~THAT *Son of Murder* will not reach his goal, I tell you. ~
@196  = ~Yes, I wish for that myself, nevertheless we cannot close our eyes to the facts - and the consequences it has for us.~
@197  = ~For us but also for him. Between now and the immortality he dreams of there is one more obstacle - me.~
@198  = ~For us but also for him. Between now and the immortality he dreams of there is one more obstacle - us.~
@199  = ~For us but also for him. Between now and the immortality he dreams of there is one more obstacle - another potent candidate for the *Son of Murder* title.~
@200  = ~Candidates there are maybe some. But none of them shall follow ever the one who spawned them.~
@201  = ~Because you say so?~
@202  = ~You seem to be ultimately determined to stop them - any of them as it seems.~
@203  = ~Yes.~
@204  = ~(Sigh) If those bones and old parchments could only tell us some more of what the seer envisioned in his lifetime.~
@205  = ~You mean this is Alaundo's tomb?~
@206  = ~Maybe Oghma has granted him more insight than was preserved over the time since?~
@207  = ~Oghma has given his disciple the warning about what we will face very soon, <CHARNAME>. The truth and the details may have blurred over time just like these old pages.~
@208  = ~It is maybe the intention of those powers that play a role in the whole plot, that not too much is revealed to us poor players yet? I am confident that you and me will find it out no matter what obstacles we will have to remove.~
@209  = ~Duergar territory? This is much more than a simple cave, <CHARNAME>.~
@210  = ~Obviously.~
@211  = ~Does your book or your lore provide us with a bit of information about what to expect here? ~
@212  = ~It is reported, that duergar and partly dwarfs have undermined a large part of the Sword Coast in their hunger for gold and ore. According to some sources, there was even an underground road similar to the King's Way above us on the surface.~
@213  = ~How long ago was that? Might it still exist today?~
@214  = ~There have been no reports about it during two human lifespans now. Duergar no longer have been seen on the surface of the Sword Coast for that long - other than occasional exiles or outcasts that is. But those caves, or rather mines still exist. Those races are known to secure their diggings for eternity.~
@215  = ~And you think we have found the entrance to that *underground coast*?~
@216  = ~I think we have found the entrance to that *underground coast*.~
@217  = ~Just look around, <CHARNAME>, this is build in a solid fashion. Look how they cleverly make use of the natural caves and structures and connect them with artificial tunnels. This looks like a system to me. And it is unlikely that more than one exist beneath this area.~
@218  = ~And what does that mean for us?~
@219  = ~Do you have any idea who might be using it these days. Maybe our foe?~
@220  = ~Your talent to state the obvious is amazing. Use your hammer, not your mouth.~
@221  = ~This cave system will be rather large - I mean several days to travel and explore - even more if we take into account that it will not be uninhibited. I do not think that those bandits and iron throne allies have made their way into here. We have seen their activities all over the surface but no hints to some secret underground ways.~
@222  = ~But the mines?~
@223  = ~Yes, the mines, but they are just local systems, not connected with this one here. And remember all their transport and communication between their locations is on the surface.~
@224  = ~Then who is down here? ~
@225  = ~I'm ready to find out who else is down here. ~
@226  = ~We have seen orcs and duergar so far. Orcs do not usually go deeper under ground than we humans do. So it is probably duergar the deeper we proceed - and maybe drow.~
@227  = ~Drow? ~
@228  = ~We will not find out unless we continue, right? Thank you once again, counsellor.~
@229  = ~I am once again perplexed how one can fill such a pretty head with such an amount of unnecessary lore.~
@230  = ~It is often reported that the drow can be found at the lower levels of areas inhabited by the duergar. The drow tolerate the duergar usually, provided the duergar let them pass for their occasional raids to the surface and then block their retreat against possible pursuers from above.~
@231  = ~A drow item, my suspicion was correct then. At least the duergar have trade with the drow.~
@232  = ~The thing looks really powerful, Sandrah.~
@233  = ~I heard those items are pretty useless on the surface.~
@234  = ~It is indeed. Drow items are energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of what they call *faerzress*. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its exceptional powers. The drawback is that all those things will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight.~
@235  = ~Mmh. Anyway, we may use it as long as we stay underground. So you think drow are already near?~
@236  = ~At least they have a connection to this cave system, it seems, but at the moment we are still too near to the surface to their liking. But we need to heed the warning and be prepared if we want to go deeper into this labyrinth.~
@237  = ~I am afraid we must. I mean, we are following a dwarf. For him this is not such a strange habitat at all, he might have gone quite deep into this system.~
@238  = ~I would rather return, Sandrah, but I have given my word to Otho to find his nephew. I won't break it, it would dishonour all of us.~
@239  = ~Right, my hero! Onwards then.~
@240  = ~Right, my heroine! Onwards then.~
@241  = ~A strange alliance. Drow weapon masters and mages with the duergar...~
@242  = ~Not really what you anticipated, Sandrah. Are you puzzled yourself?~
@243  = ~You have erred a bit, it seems. Or maybe things have changed in the decades since your book has been last amended?~
@244  = ~These drow and duergar seem to be under some common command. We have seen the same on the surface with the Chill and the Black Talons and the orcs.~
@245  = ~And you assume the same happens in the underground coast as well? But not the same one in control as above. Some underground equivalent to the Iron Throne.~
@246  = ~Oh my, <CHARNAME>, if you are right, then there is bad trouble on its way. There is such a legendary organisation and it is led by drow. If those are behind this, then we face an enemy deadlier than those Iron Throne puppets.~
@247  = ~And who might that be?~
@248  = ~Now you will boast to know who they are...~
@249  = ~The worst criminal organisation that exists on the surface and in the underground of Faerun, the Bregan D'aerthe.~
@250  = ~I have never heard of them?~
@251  = ~The what? How can they be famous if no one has heard about them?~
@252  = ~The name is about all I can tell you about them. Few people even know that much, and not many lived long enough to tell much. The only other thing about them is rumour that they are led by a drow that even the drow matrons fear - Jarlaxle.~
@253  = ~The question is, what they do here, so close to the surface of the Sword Coast and at a time where we have this crisis up there.~
@254  = ~We can only hope that this guy Jarlaxle is not in league with the Iron Throne and its leaders then.~
@255  = ~The deeper we come, the worse it looks, <CHARNAME>.~
@256  = ~After that duergar assault, these bandits here are just a joke for us.~
@257  = ~Yes, they are no longer real opponents for our fighting skills as a group by now. No, what I meant is that it bothers me that Black Talons are down here at all.~
@258  = ~Well, I guess I see what you mean. What do they do among the drow and duergar if they are not in league with them. Even if this is not part of the Iron Throne operation, there is obviously a connection.~
@259  = ~Now I see! Why should they be here if there is not an alliance between the Iron Throne and this drow organisation you mentioned before.~
@260  = ~You say it, <CHARNAME>. Like it or not, there is no other way than to make it to the heart of this installation and find it out. Or even better, cross their evil plans once again.~
@261  = ~Ha! We did that before and we will strike once again without them expecting us down here at all. The moment of surprise is again on our side.~
@262  = ~Sometimes I do not really like to be right in my analysis. This time I wished I had erred.~
@263  = ~Rieltar and the Iron Throne in league with the Bregan D'aerthe, what could be worse?~
@264  = ~So this is where those bastards got their supplies from. An alliance with the Underdark. Name an evil deed and those traitors have already done it.~
@265  = ~Still there is a bit of hope in all this for us now, <CHARNAME>.~
@266  = ~Sandrah, you and your unbeatable optimism. Where do you see the light at the end of this tunnel now?~
@267  = ~As much as I admire your optimistic view at times, I am afraid this is really grave news even for you.~
@268  = ~But what we have heard is that this alliance runs all but smooth, actually it is about to break. And now at this exact point we have dealt them another unexpected blow by destroying their local basis here. Rieltar and the Throne is defeated twice today - and he may not be aware for it for some time as there are no witnesses left to report what has happened here today.~
@269  = ~Hey, yes, now I see what you mean. Listen, nobody knows we have been here at all - let Jarlaxle believe this destruction was caused by Mortius and Shar Nadal and their men getting into arguments with each other.~
@270  = ~Brilliant, <CHARNAME>, let us sneak out like we sneaked in without leaving our traces. As we killed members of all fractions involved and have not left any evidence of ourselves behind yet, your plan will work. I suggest to move further on instead of returning the way we came.~
@271  = ~Why do you propose that last?~
@272  = ~It's seldom my habit to turn around.~
@273  = ~If I have plotted our way through this labyrinth right, we have generally moved into a northerly direction, and we have not gone down into the earth but stayed at almost the same level all the time. Remember when we talked about that subterranean King's Way earlier.~
@274  = ~I get your point, there may be another exit to the surface in this direction soon. The Iron Throne men must have come that way from Baldur's Gate, otherwise Ferthgil must had seen them on the route from the southern entrance.~
@275  = ~Now comes that part of our underground trip where I am glad I am not this group's leader, <CHARNAME>.~
@276  = ~What are you talking about now, Sandrah. Have I missed something?~
@277  = ~Yes, it is not an easy duty to return with the news of somebody's loved ones death. Not an easy duty but a duty nonetheless.~
@278  = ~Well, Otho deserves to know the truth about his nephew. And we should return the hammer to him.~
@279  = ~You are right, the sooner we bring this step behind us, the better. We should leave here as quick as we can anyway, nobody should suspect us to have anything to do with the raiding of this underground labyrinth.~
@280  = ~<CHARNAME>, можно тебя на минуту, пожалуйста.~
@281  = ~Да, моя советчица?~
@282  = ~Что на этот раз?~
@283  = ~Я действительно говорю сейчас, как твоя советчица. Мы должны подумать о том, чтобы не брать этот бандитский лагерь лобовой атакой. И дело не только в силе, с которой нам придётся столкнуться, но и в том, что при этом пленники могут быть убиты, а боссы получат шанс спастись от нас в предсказуемой суматохе боя.~
@284  = ~Это надо учитывать, ты права. Я бы избежал такого шага, если бы знал альтернативу.~ ~Это надо учитывать, ты права. Я бы избежала такого шага, если бы знала альтернативу.~
@285  = ~Неуверенность моего бойца на переднем крае - последнее, что мне нужно в этой ситуации. Сандра, ты меня глубоко разочаровала.~
@286  = ~Ты рекомендуешь другой способ действий? Ты знаешь, время нас поджимает.~
@287  = ~Прежде чем несправедливо осуждать меня за трусость, может попробуешь начала прислушаться к моим словам?~
@288  = ~Никто не называет тебя трусом, Сандра. Но я принял решение и надеюсь, что ты ему последуешь. Разве что ты действительно можешь предложить альтернативу прямо сейчас.~ ~Никто не называет тебя трусом, Сандра. Но я приняла решение и надеюсь, что ты ему последуешь. Разве что ты действительно можешь предложить альтернативу прямо сейчас.~
@289  = ~Если ты такая умная, расскажи нам СВОЙ план, но сделай это побыстрее. Мы не можем стоять здесь и болтать, враг может нас обнаружить в любой момент.~
@290  = ~Мы видели и слышали сообщения о близлежащих районах, особенно о том, что Ларсвуд и Пелдвейл также находятся в руках этих бандитов. Мы также в последнее время немного сократили их ряды. Давай найдём там на периметре какого-нибудь младшего командира и убедим его, что мы - присланное подкрепление.~
@291  = ~Ты имеешь в виду, чтобы влиться в их ряды и попытаться пройти в главный лагерь без необходимости пробиваться туда с боем?~
@292  = ~Это дало бы нам шанс узнать нашего врага изнутри, прежде чем мы решим нанести удар в случае необходимости. Если нам повезёт, и мы будем достаточно умны, мы можем даже получить информацию об их организации и о тех, кто действительно дёргает за ниточки. Сомневаюсь, что мы сможем получить такие сведения при лобовой атакой, даже успешной.~
@293  = ~Сандра, извини за мою грубость. Твои доводы убедительны. Пойдём в Пелдвейл и поищем там их представителей.~
@294  = ~Я был немного резок, Сандра, извини. Нам действительно следует отступить в Ларсвуд и попытаться осуществить твой план оттуда.~ ~Я была немного резкой, Сандра, извини. Нам действительно следует отступить в Ларсвуд и попытаться осуществить твой план оттуда.~
@295  = ~Это хитрый и умный план, Сандра. Извини, что я был с тобой груб раньше. Если бы у нас только было время, чтобы его выполнить. Лагерь перед нами, и отступать назад - трудное решение. Даже если оно, может быть, лучшее.~ ~Это хитрый и умный план, Сандра. Извини, что я была с тобой груба раньше. Если бы у нас только было время, чтобы его выполнить. Лагерь перед нами, и отступать назад - трудное решение. Даже если оно, может быть, лучшее.~
@296  = ~Ладно. Я тебя выслушал - но это моё решение. Разговор окончен.~ ~Ладно. Я тебя выслушала - но это моё решение. Разговор окончен.~
@297  = ~Саревок...~
@298  = ~Это имя указано здесь, в этом письме. Цепочка вроде бы ещё не закончилась. Похоже, он следующий за Даваэорном.~
@299  = ~Саревок, кто это?~
@300  = ~Ещё одна часть этой головоломки встала на своё место. Это мужчина твоего возраста, которого подозревают, что он дитя Баала.~
@301  = ~И теперь он стоит за операциями Железного Трона. Я уверен, что это не совпадение.~ ~И теперь он стоит за операциями Железного Трона. Я уверена, что это не совпадение.~
@302  = ~Судя по содержимому этого письма, он следующий в иерархии над Даваэорном.~
@303  = ~Похоже, ты слышала это имя раньше?~
@304  = ~Я тоже. Этот Саревок загадочным образом исчез некоторое время назад. Теперь он был бы мужчиной твоего возраста, возможно, тот, кто втайне развил силу, унаследованную от Баала, до значительного уровня. Он наверняка замешан в этой интриге, если он не тот, за кем мы гоняемся.~
@305  = ~Раньше уже было несколько намёков на причастность потомка Баала. Теперь у него появилось имя. Думаю, я уже однажды встречался с ним!~ ~Раньше уже было несколько намеков на причастность потомка Баала. Теперь у него появилось имя. Думаю, я уже однажды встречалась с ним!~
@306  = ~Ты имеешь в виду, в тот день, когда погиб твой приёмный отец?~
@307  = ~Чёрное существо, убившее Горайона. Безликий начинает приоткрывать лицо. Саревок.~
@308  = ~О, боги, <CHARNAME>, берегись, это пустынные тролли.~
@309  = ~Я знаю, что тролли регенерируют, и их можно убить только огнём и заклинаниями. Спасибо, что напомнила мне использовать это здесь.~
@310  = ~Я и сам это вижу, но мы можем убить их огненным оружием и заклинаниями.~ ~Я и сама это вижу, но мы можем убить их огненным оружием и заклинаниями.~
@311  = ~То, что ты знаешь, верно для других видов троллей. Эти пустынные тролли невосприимчивы к огню. Нам нужно использовать против них кислоту. Нашим лучникам пригодились бы кислотные стрелы.~
@312  = ~(Сандра ненадолго оставила группу, чтобы пролистать страницы своей всезнающей книги.)~
@313  = ~Ох, почему мы не подумали об этом раньше. В книге, конечно, будет сказано о шахтах.~
@314  = ~У нас есть карты и знания о Побережье Меча. Только слепой не увидит. У тебя есть карта Клоаквуда!~
@315  = ~Пфф, <CHARNAME>, лучше пока не вселяй в Имоен слишком больших надежд. Пожалуйста, дай я сначала посмотрю. - - - Хм. --- Ага, хмм...~
@316  = ~И?~
@317  = ~Ты хочешь сначала хорошую или плохую новость?~
@318  = ~Я бы сказал, что любые новости - это уже лучше, чем то, что у нас есть.~ ~Я бы сказала, что любые новости - это уже лучше, чем то, что у нас есть.~
@319  = ~Шахта Клоаквуда когда-то была старой шахтой дварфов. Даже когда она работала, её местоположение держалось в секрете их кланами. Но даже после этого прошло очень много лет.~
@320  = ~Дварфы копали всё глубже и глубже, и однажды натолкнулись на нечто вроде подземной реки или водоема. Вся шахта была затоплена, и многие из них утонули при этой катастрофе.~
@321  = ~За прошедшие с тех пор годы было предпринято лишь несколько попыток снова найти эту систему пещер, но все безрезультатны. И немногочисленные сведения, что существовали о их местоположении, тоже уменьшились.~
@322  = ~Если я верно помню уроки из Кендлкипа, Клоаквуд покрывает почти четверть Побережья Меча. Никаких поселений и дорог там нет, только тропинки, по которым ходят безвестные друиды.~
@323  = ~Не забудь также упомянуть популяции гигантских пауков и виверн. Но ничто из этого не должно помешать нам отправиться туда, чтобы спасти Хеннинга и продолжить преследование твоего врага.~
@324  = ~Нашего врага, Сандра, нашего. Значит всё, что нам нужно сделать, это найти иголку в стоге сена размером с Клоаквуд. Чего же мы ждём?~
@325  = ~Ты мне ещё не всё сказала, я вижу по твоему задумчивому взгляду, у тебя есть что-то ещё на уме.~
@326  = ~Это просто мысль, которая пришла мне в голову. Этот тайный враг отравляет руду в главной шахте Побережья Меча, вызвав железный кризис. Теперь мы знаем, что, возможно, у него есть связь с ещё более крупной шахтой, если её снова запустить в эксплуатацию. Возможно, он нашёл способ сделать это, чтобы поставлять железо, когда другие уже не могут. Это способ обрести власть.~
@327  = ~Но мы испортили эту часть его плана своими действиями в шахте Нашкеля. И те, на кого он охотился, теперь стали охотиться за ним.~
@328  = ~Даже с той дополнительной информацией, которую мы сейчас получили, нашей следующей целью, похоже, остаётся лагерь бандитов и Тазок.~
@329  = ~(Sandrah pours a glass of burgundy coloured thick wine from a decanter on the table and drinks a tiny sip of it, closing her eyes to fully appreciate the moment. She moves up to you and holds the glass to your lips. She now looks straight into your eyes with her own bottomless and impenetrable look, that seems to say everything and nothing at the same time.)~
@330  = ~(You take a small sip from the glass as well and then take it from her hand to put it on the table with your eyes still looking deeper and deeper into hers.) ~
@331  = ~(You take a small sip from the glass as well and await her next move.) ~
@332  = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@333  = ~I love you, Sandrah. This night was wonderful. I will never forget it. Look at the sun coming up. I look ahead to another wonderful day with you.~
@334  = ~Last night was wonderful, my darling. I hope it was not the last we spend like this. But look at the sun rising. Somewhere down in this mist over Faerun lies my destiny.~
@335  = ~Last night was...I don't know what was in that wine, but I did things that had better been left undone. You and me - I respect you and care for you but there it ends.~
@336  = ~Somewhere down in this mist that covers Faerun lies OUR destiny. The sun will soon dissolve the morning mist and things will become clear.~
@337  = ~Let us go down to see our comrades. You are right. It is time to bring further light into this mist that covers our future. One more kiss before we go. (Embrace her passionately.)~
@338  = ~Let us go down to see our comrades. You are right. It is time to bring further light into this mist that covers our future. I hope I have a true friend by my side through it all.~
@339  = ~(Sandrah returns your kiss in what seems to be a never ending moment.)~
@340  = ~Let us go to our comrades below, see how they enjoyed the stay. And do not forget to see my father in his study, he may have some valid information for our further travels.~
@341  = ~You have. And know that I do not give up any case that easily. Time will tell.~
@342  = ~Remember how you told me about this scientist when we talked about old places on the Sword Coast, <CHARNAME>.~
@343  = ~Yes, do you think there is anything here that has to do with the ghost of Beregost? ~
@344  = ~When you look at these engravings all over the wall they appear to be of the same ancient period and culture. There may exist some connection.~
@345  = ~Do you think it will be safe to take any relics from this tomb with us? I mean just in case.~
@346  = ~Safe? We should be alert and we should search for traps and similar guards that may exist in a place like this. There is a good chance that those who build this place took measures against theft, even beyond their own existence.~
@347  = ~Do you think that it is theft to take something from here?~
@348  = ~As a priest, is it a sacrilege for you to take things from a place like this, I mean, do you think this here is sacred?~
@349  = ~Those people are long dead and the things they left behind here no longer *belong* to them. Will it not be better if those dead artefacts could still be of some use to the living? Be it to lay the Beregost ghosts to rest, or be it for us to learn something from the events and people of older times.~
@350  = ~The reason I warned you, <CHARNAME>, is that those dead may had a different opinion during their lifetime and have therefore guarded it against what they would call *thieves*.~
@351  = ~So this is the famous or rather *infamous* Vampire's Revenge. <CHARNAME>, remember not to use it.~
@352  = ~But what to do with it now? ~
@353  = ~I hear your words but I will decide myself. ~
@354  = ~We should get ourself some holy water from the Beregost Temple and then go to visit the ghost cave nearby. Torqion required those two items to end his spooking. I think the town's people would be grateful if we could end the horror there.~
@355  = ~Thank you, my counsellor.  ~
@356  = ~One possible option.  ~
@357  = ~We have done to the area around here some favour, and also to this lost soul, <CHARNAME>. I think we should keep the cursed sword. I have read, that it is considered to be the key to something from the past. Maybe we can find out something during our travels.~
@358  = ~Maybe a smith or a learned mage know something. ~
@359  = ~Torqion seems to have dropped it when he *died*. Maybe a smith or a learned mage know something. ~
@360  = ~It will not hurt to ask Thalantyr or Taerom next time we pass by their houses.~
@361  = ~Let us do that. It is not urgent but maybe we learn something interesting about the Sword Coast's past in the end.~
@362  = ~Say, <CHARNAME>, will we go to the 'Sturgeon' soon to pick up Coran again?~
@363  = ~He is gone to take up some responsibility - after all. It is strange that just you would insist of taking him away from his *family* again.~
@364  = ~You are as fond of him as you are of his little baby, aren't you. A bit too much for my liking.~
@365  = ~Sure, he should have settled his affairs by now, especially with that extra help you supplied to him.~
@366  = ~It is not really a family, <CHARNAME>, as the love between the parents is not there. Coran had admitted his responsibility and he will take care of Namara's well-being from now on. There is no need however to stay where he is not wanted.~
@367  = ~I see. But he is wanted here - by you, at least.~
@368  = ~I fully admit that, <CHARNAME>. Nevertheless the baby belongs to her mother - but the man does not.~
@369  = ~He belongs to you then? Well, we will see.~
@370  = ~(Sandrah has stopped at the wayside to inspect something on her fashionable boot. Her shapely leg and foot is fully exposed and you notice that the male members of your party have stopped to admire the wonderful display. Including Xan.)~
@371  = ~(You stop beside Xan to admire Sandrah's beauty as well. In your fantasy you run your fingers along the silken skin of Sandrah's leg. You silently smile to yourself knowing that this is exactly what you will do at rest this eve.)~
@372  = ~(You stop beside Sandrah and say, audible for her ears only.) Do you know how everybody is watching you, even Xan.~
@373  = ~(Sandrah continues with her boot-laces, while she responds to you in the same volume.) And does it improve his mood, can you see that? I do not dare to look around myself, it would be a bit to obvious.~
@374  = ~You do that for him, and I thought you did it for me?~
@375  = ~He seems to admire it - like everybody, including myself. Say, do you want to cure him, healer? I declare him a hopeless case.~
@376  = ~Darling, I do not exclude you. All you see is yours to have whenever you want.But you are right, I try to humour our poor moody elf a bit.~
@377  = ~Good luck, Sandrah. I hope you will not drench me in tears should you fail with him. I declare him a hopeless case.~
@378  = ~I would not agree to that. You know that I am very reluctant to declare any case as hopeless. And the initial results are promising.~
@379  = ~I can only hope you will not spend too much time at his *sickbed* and away from me. ~
@380  = ~The whole cure could be easier if I had a bit of assistance with the case?~
@381  = ~Do you mean me, Sandrah?~
@382  = ~What does that mean, Sandrah? Do you want to involve me also into this case - that is...strange.~
@383  = ~<CHARNAME>, as the leader of this group you have a responsibility for those you lead. No one should suffer if help could be provided. And - just in case you have not noticed it yet - this patient would not reject a bit more interest from your side.~
@384  = ~Sometimes your fantasies are really wild, Sandrah. But maybe that is what I love you for. ~
@385  = ~As long as our relationship is not impacted by this. My love for you is too important to put it on risk. ~
@386  = ~Healing is your expertise, so do what you must do.~
@387  = ~Even if...keep your nose out of it, will you?~
@388  = ~I think I owe you an explanation?~
@389  = ~That was indeed a puzzling situation. What was wrong with that mage?~
@390  = ~He obviously had something to hide. And he must have sensed either my heritage or my blessing by Mystra. He must be very much afraid of righteous mages like my father. ~
@391  = ~Is that all? Or is it you now who is hiding something from me.~
@392  = ~(Sandrah looks you straight in the eye.) I am not hiding anything about that mage. I know not more than what I just told you. We should just be careful if we meet him again or ever hear something of him again. ~
@393  = ~Whatever. Let's forget about it.~
@394  = ~Yes, I see. Thank you for the warning. Maybe we will not ever meet this man again.~
@395  = ~Now I see why this Haeball had raised my suspicion the first time we met. One of those fiddling with magical secrets far too big for them. They summon incredible creatures to this plane without the ability to handle them. He had all reasons to fear me and my father.~
@396  = ~If we can get the corpse from him, we can send these monsters back before they can do much harm.~
@397  = ~As long as those creatures stay in here, they do no harm to the Sword Coast. Only stray adventurers like us would risk to find them. That is the price for sticking your nose into every hole you find.~
@398  = ~<CHARNAME>, we should do something about it. After some time these creatures will get bored and find their way out of here. We surely do not want them run through the streets of Nashkel.~
@399  = ~Surely not, my counsellor.~
@400  = ~Do I need to care?~
@401  = ~(Laughs) I know some of them. But honestly, <CHARNAME>, we should do something about it. After some time these creatures will get bored and find their way out of here. We surely do not want them run through the streets of Nashkel.~
@402  = ~That would include betrayal by yourself, mageling. Your mistrust in my blood is repaid my mistrust for you.~
@403  = ~What would you advise, counsellor?~
@404  = ~Let us avoid Hasdar and this mage here for the time being until we may have found additional facts in this mysterious affair.~
@405  = ~The orcs here really want to resurrect General Ghotal. There is a great danger lurking here, <CHARNAME>.~
@406  = ~I think, my learned one, you have to enlighten us poor unknowledgeable fellows on who that is - or was, rather.~
@407  = ~Is the cunning of those orc hords really of any significance to us or anyone on the Sword Coast?~
@408  = ~Strange, you are normally well learned in the lore of the Sword Coast. But maybe there is not so much known about that time south in Candlekeep. Maybe the threat was more on Waterdeep.~
@409  = ~Anyway, General Ghotal was the greatest orc leader ever. He almost succeeded to unite all the fierce northern Clans of the orcs and he led them against the joint forces of Waterdeep and the Sword Coast. He only failed in the end because his own forces betrayed him and started their endless internal quarrels again before the final battle was won.~
@410  = ~Here on the Fields of Death must be the place of his final defeat.~
@411  = ~But when did all of that happen. Surely too long ago to still resurrect him, even if he was such a strong leader.~
@412  = ~Hm, orcs. As long as they waste their time to pray for a long gone leader, that keeps them occupied and out of our ways, right?~
@413  = ~You normally would be right. This battle was two generations ago and the fiercest the Realms had ever seen. The problem is, that there are many hints to the fact that Ghotal was Myrkul's son .~
@414  = ~You mean another godchild, from one of the Dead Three, Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul.~
@415  = ~<CHARNAME>, the lore we have of these events is really few. You at Candlekeep had not even heard about it at all, and even my knowledge and my tome provide little less than what I just told you. It almost seems, that our side - the humans and elves who fought the northern orc clans - did not really want to remember those days once the fight was over.~
@416  = ~Who would blame them, Sandrah.~
@417  = ~Maybe they blamed themselves. Even though our books try to make Ghotal look like a kind of half-beast invader, it does not really fit. The way he organised the orc Clans and was about to defeat the southern forces does not sound like he was just a primitive aggressor. And if you look at the rest of the tales from that time, you would get the picture of the southern people expanding their lands largely to the north and to the east.~
@418  = ~You mean that it was probably rather us who intruded into the lands of the orcs than them attacking. Then Ghotal had united them to defend their territories, their homelands against our expansion. That would explain the neglect of that part in our oh so glorious history.~
@419  = ~Watch out, <CHARNAME>, I sense a deadly trap here. Until we have found the required keys, we should not touch anything here at this sacred place.~
@420  = ~A sacred place and guarded by orcs? Strange to hear such things from you, I have learned that you are not superstitious.~
@421  = ~I do not blame you, because it is easy to forget, but I am a priestess after all. This place is powerfully guarded by an ancient god or goddess. It may be connected to the events we have found on the Fields of the Death.~
@422  = ~This General Ghotal, the orc leader. We heard that the orcs seek a way for his resurrection. ~
@423  = ~Wasn't that strange mage Haeball mentioned in connection with that?~
@424  = ~Whatever key may be required to open it. Mmh, we best stay away from it then, my counsellor.~
@425  = ~A rusty dagger with a strange feeling to it. I have sensed this god's presence recently.~
@426  = ~Do you remember where that was or why?~
@427  = ~You mentioned such a strange feeling about an unknown god or goddess at that orc circle in the Wood of the Dead.~
@428  = ~Wait a minute...hm...ah, yes, that orc ritual in the Wood of the Dead. The stones there had that same aura.~
@429  = ~You warned me of a deadly trap there. May this dagger be the key to it? ~
@430  = ~Right, my genius. The stones there had that same aura.~
@431  = ~It is one part of the key, yes, but it is not complete. It makes no sense to try it unless we have the other half. Perhaps we will find it on our further travels.~
@432  = ~With what we have found until now, we should take the opportunity and talk to Hasdar in Baldur's Gate again.~
@433  = ~Do you really counsel me to give him the book he requires? ~
@434  = ~I propose to try and get as much information out of him as we can, using the bits and pieces we have gathered so far. Our goal must be, to stop whatever is brewing up there in the northern woods and around the Field of the Dead. A new orc war is not what the Sword Coast needs now.~
@435  = ~Am I right to think, that you want to use again your methods of threatening and bluff, I could study on you now every once in a while? I will never sit down for a card game with you, my counsellor.~
@436  = ~We'll go there but it will be me who does the talking.~
@437  = ~Now we must ask for our reward for the book from Hasdar with a bit more emphasis. He is surely on his way to the east and to the temple in the Forest of Forgotten Souls.~
@438  = ~We will face an even more alert opponent by now. But what the hell, what has to be done must be done. And this cult *must* be destroyed.~
@439  = ~Here it is, Ghotal's famed sword!~
@440  = ~The thing can really make one shiver. We should not keep it.~
@441  = ~ An enormous weapon, it gives you some idea about the orc leader that wielded it. Do you think it is safe to keep it? ~
@442  = ~It is said that it made legions of opponents run in panic on the pure sight of it in Ghotal's hand. And even move lay slain at his feet if they dared to stand against him.~
@443  = ~I would recommend to keep it, so it does not fall into the orc's hands. They were feverishly trying to gain it, so it must play some role in their attempt to resurrect Ghotal.~
@444  = ~ Fine, but keep it hidden in the backpack. Up here in the north I would not dare to let anyone know we have it. ~
@445  = ~I wonder why there is no corpse in this grave. The orcs cannot yet have revived the General, as we are the ones to have found the keys.~
@446  = ~If the orcs should get there hands on it, they may still succeed in resurrecting the General. His body is not here.~
@447  = ~That is somehow strange, a tomb for a sword only? ~
@448  = ~There is the tomb on the Fields of the Death. I have studied what little my book has to say about those dark days around the battle and his annihilation. It seems that the paladins of Helm have buried him and sealed the grave with a powerful symbol.~
@449  = ~Maybe that is what is hidden in the altar in the Northern Citadel.~
@450  = ~Another key to to be searched and found? Or do we just leave the General in his grave?~
@451  = ~Then the risk would remain for the orcs to finally find and resurrect him. Let us not stop halfway but end this threat for once and for all.~
@452  = ~For that we would need whatever is hidden in the altar in the Northern Citadel, don't you think so?~
@453  = ~It would be a strange coincidence if something else would be in that citadel. The building was erected shortly after the battle, so most likely that is where the key to the grave is kept.~
@454  = ~An enormous weapon, adequate for the orc leader that wielded it. Do you think It is safe to keep it? ~
@455  = ~Oh, yes, Fabio, the most famous bard of Restenford and thousands of other places, or maybe not. Actually I had forgotten him completely until I just saw him again. He obviously made a lasting impression on me, just like his *music*.~
@456  = ~Haha, he looks just like the type young girls would dream about - when there is no beach on a southern island.~
@457  = ~I am afraid exactly that. I have to confess, even I was a silly little teenage girl at one time. But to clarify things in my favour, nothing had happened because this star bard had to leave the island for his grand tour (smiles amused).~
@458  = ~Sandrah and her boyfriends, soso. Interesting.~
@459  = ~Oh, spare me the details.~
@460  = ~Итак, то, что мы обнаружили сегодня, является лишь частью гораздо более крупной операции <CHARNAME>.~
@461  = ~Этот полуорк определённо не был убийцей Горайона. Но, по крайней мере, теперь мы снова сделали шахты доступными для нормальной работы.~
@462  = ~Письма, которые мы нашли, похоже, говорят именно об этом. Кроме того, этот полуорк определённо не был убийцей Горайона. Сегодня мы не достигли своей цели.~
@463  = ~Мы должны сообщить о наших открытиях Берруну в Нашкеле. С теми предметами, которые мы нашли там внизу, они смогут снова открыть шахты и уменьшить влияние железного кризиса. Но с другой стороны, наши дела здесь, наверное, не останутся незамеченными. Если они ещё не знали этого, то теперь они будут уверены, что мы их преследуем.~
@464  = ~Есть идеи, кто *ОНИ* такие?~
@465  = ~Не больше, чем тебе, <CHARNAME>, мне имена Транциг или Тазок не знакомы. Посетив Берегост, мы можем узнать больше.~
@466  = ~Значит, кажется, пора возвращаться на север.~
@467  = ~Не больше, чем ты, <CHARNAME>, я никогда не слышала о Тазоке, но имя Транциг вызывает некоторые нежелательные воспоминания, верно, Бранвен? Посетив Берегост, мы можем узнать больше.~
@468  = ~Those dark hints were to be expected, <CHARNAME>, as we come closer to the truth behind all these events and their connection to your heritage.~
@469  = ~The seer called me a seeker, which is not too remote in my view.~
@470  = ~More than the usual mumbojumbo of those guys I could not make out from his overly picturesque hints. Could you?~
@471  = ~Yes, yes, I must walk through the darkness to come to the light. My, don't we do that every day?~
@472  = ~I would largely agree to your sceptical view on the guy - if he had not mentioned the *Undercity*, which is a bit more precise than those usual allusions of the wannabe prophets.~
@473  = ~So it means you can make out any sense in this?~
@474  = ~Like most places of importance in this region, Baldur's Gate is a relatively young settlement as you may recall from the stories about Balduran himself. But like all our settlements it has been build at a place that had already seen earlier inhabitants and towns before that.~
@475  = ~Yes, I remember similar stories about Candlekeep - that it was build on top of an older monastery. Imoen and me always wanted to find the entrance to the legendary catacombs that shall exist below the current settlement, but the monks were not very cooperative when we hit the topic.~
@476  = ~The same is true for this city, <CHARNAME>. And the darkness to pass before you see the light may be the darkness of the past.~
@477  = ~Now you start to sound as cryptic as those seers themselves.~
@478  = ~If I get your point right, you mean once again that we need to look into the past to find out what is going on in the presence?~
@479  = ~The *Undercity* of Baldur's Gate is the equivalent to your Candlekeep Catacombs. It is said to be a cultic and ritual place since the beginning of civilisation on the Sword Coast. Most of its history is forgotten by now, including where exactly it is below our feet.~
@480  = ~And you guess such a place holds the answer for the things that lie behind the Iron Throne and this Sarevok?~
@481  = ~My book has told me, that among the bloody and barbaric rituals that the ancient place below has seen, were those to worship the God of Murder - Bhaal.~
@482  = ~(The strange wizards appearance and threat has left you completely speechless and confused. Will Sandrah have any idea what has just happened?)~
@483  = ~Who was that? What did he want? I am completely lost.~
@484  = ~The Sword Coast these days is crowded with morons. I'm embarrassed.~
@485  = ~So am I, <CHARNAME>. Let us take a moment and try to recapture what has happened and what we can make out of it.~
@486  = ~Simple. Another threat from my unknown enemy and the killer of Gorion. It will not stop us, right? ~
@487  = ~An undefined threat by an unknown enemy? Is there something I do not see? ~
@488  = ~Look at it piece by piece, <CHARNAME>, let us see what pieces we have and where to put them.~
@489  = ~First then. - The man was from Rashemen of origin and one of the rare male wizards there, as the magic in that land is mostly handled by the women. However, from his hateful words about his homeland, we can deduct that he is probably a renegade who is now in the services of someone here on the Sword Coast.~
@490  = ~That someone being the one we hunt, if I understood correctly.~
@491  = ~Yes. (Sandrah smiles reassuring at you.) Do you see how we progress looking at it calmly piece by piece? Let us continue.~
@492  = ~Second then. He mentioned an item we have found, something that was lost for long time.~
@493  = ~We are finding all kinds of artefacts all the time, this sword of Mystra, an ancient shield of a dead knight, who knows what...~
@494  = ~He came after we have found that strange piece of old cloth...~
@495  = ~That gives us clue number Three then. This strange piece of cloth is a kind of trace to the past, and it is there we have to find the reason for all that is going on in the present.~
@496  = ~But our enemy is here in the present and he is not sitting still to wait for us. Whatever his motives are, we need to act fast, rather than to dwell on long gone things.~
@497  = ~Yes and no. We have to follow any hint we find here and now. But it will be very helpful to gain as much knowledge as possible about our foe and his motives before we have to face him. It is a mighty enemy, we know already, so knowledge will brings us the advantage we need to defeat him.~
@498  = ~A rising God...~
@499  = ~..is that what we are fighting? ~
@500  = ~This sheds some light on recent encounters, but maybe not yet enough...~
@501  = ~You have deciphered that strange diary, Sandrah?~
@502  = ~If you have books to study, I'm content. At least it keeps you from talking.~
@503  = ~I will tell you what I found and then we will see together what it really reveals to us.~
@504  = ~I think we need to take some time for that, when we have got to a safer place. I will talk to you about it later. ~
@505  = ~Fine, you seem to be puzzled. I have learned something from you by now. Let us put all the facts we know in front of us and then see where they may fit.~
@506  = ~You will not keep quiet until I let you spit it out. (Sigh) What is it this time?~
@507  = ~Very good, <CHARNAME>.~
@508  = ~The scout who carried and wrote this journal was from Rashemen. He mentions his master, an Othlor. (You bite on your lips not to interrupt Sandrah.)~
@509  = ~The death of this man and the last entries into his diary date to the time roughly around our birth, at the end of the Time of Troubles.~
@510  = ~In the mission from the Othlor, the man was following a group of travellers across the Sword Coast. Those travellers where trying to cover their path because of something they were carrying.~
@511  = ~I will be damned if this Othlor is not the same one that made his strange assault on us!~
@512  = ~An Othlor, a male Rashemen mage? How does he fit into the picture? ~
@513  = ~Let me tell you the rest of it first, before we try to analyse things.~
@514  = ~The travellers party was attacked by bandits before the scout could do anything more. There was also a drow priestess at the scene of the ambush, although probably just another witness of the scene. However, the scout tried to hide in some tunnels, which were the Ulcaster ruins and he died down there, killed by the monsters we have met down there. This is where the diary ends.~
@515  = ~Viconia? She mentioned the same scene! It was how she got possession of that strange artefact she gave you. It seems now we really must keep our eyes open for more pieces to find out what those people tried to hide and what this Othlor was after...~
@516  = ~Viconia? She mentioned the same scene! It was how she got possession of that strange artefact she gave you. And this Othlor is still around and after the creatures he was pursuing then. It seems now we really must keep our eyes open for more pieces to find out what those people tried to hide and who they were...~
@517  = ~Ghosts of the past. But my studies of the scripts at Candlekeep have taught me, that our present events are always connected to what has been before us...~
@518  = ~<CHARNAME>? ~
@519  = ~Sandrah, the story of Khalindra's second child lies heavy on your thoughts. You do not need to deny it, I know and love you well enough. What do you propose to do? ~
@520  = ~Sandrah, ever since we heard the story of Khalindra's second child, you're in your thoughts. You do not need to deny it, I know you well enough. What do you propose to do? ~
@521  = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>, it is this mystery and the reason for my mother's early death that made me leave Waterdeep in the beginning. But by now I am sure this is no longer my quest alone. It is ours. ~
@522  = ~You have told me before and I am convinced by now that our stories are entwined. Only your father at Waterdeep can provide us with the information we need now.~
@523  = ~You have told me before - but I still do not understand why - this story is our common one. I am willing to aid you nevertheless and go with you to your father to find out.~
@524  = ~There is a Bhaalspawn in your past, and it looks like my heritage is somehow connected to Bhaal as well. Your father *MUST* know the truth. He has been following us around all the time, and it was not to oversee his daughter's activities. This time I will get some answers from him. I swear. ~
@525  = ~*Take this symbol of what you are*. What did Mystra give you, <CHARNAME>?~
@526  = ~It is a baby statue, clad with the bed cloth we have reconstructed. What does it mean?~
@527  = ~A baby replica clad in the bed cloth we have reconstructed. Is that me? Does it mean the child that was rescued, hidden and hunted was me?~
@528  = ~*Take a look at who you are from the tower that overlooks the Realms*. Let us go up to my tower then, <CHARNAME>, it overlooks the Realms.~
@529  = ~I remember your words after our wonderful first night. The words you said to me when we stood up there and looked over the morning mist covering Faerun. You promised me, that one day the mist will uncover the truth. Let us go and see, Sandrah. ~
@530  = ~I remember your words after that night in your room. The words you said to me when we stood up there and looked over the morning mist covering Faerun. You promised me, that one day the mist will uncover the truth. Let us go and see, Sandrah. ~
@531  = ~It is a baby statue, clad with the bed cloth we have reconstructed, a little girl. What does it mean?~
@532  = ~A baby girl replica clad in the bed cloth we have reconstructed. Is that me? Does it mean the child that was rescued, hidden and hunted was me?~
@533  = ~(Сандра подходит очень близко к тебе и берёт тебя за руку. Она смотрит на тебя своими бездонными глазами.) Ты плохо спал, <CHARNAME>. Что тебя так беспокоит?~ ~(Сандра подходит очень близко к тебе и берёт тебя за руку. Она смотрит на тебя своими бездонными глазами.) Ты плохо спала, <CHARNAME>. Что тебя так беспокоит?~
@534  = ~Я впервые увидел во сне Горайона с тех пор, как покинул Кендлкип. В этом сне было что-то вроде послания, но я его не понял.~ ~Я впервые увидела во сне Горайона с тех пор, как покинула Кендлкип. В этом сне было что-то вроде послания, но я его не поняла.~
@535  = ~Расскажешь мне этот сон? Он изменил тебя, <CHARNAME>, ты нашёл в себе новые способности.~ ~Расскажешь мне этот сон? Он изменил тебя, <CHARNAME>, ты нашла в себе новые способности.~
@536  = ~Это был просто сон. А способности приобретаются от нашего опыта в дороге.~
@537  = ~(Рассказать ей о своём сне и об обнаруженных новых способностях.)~
@538  = ~Будь осторожен, мой дорогой. Внутри тебя происходит борьба, ты можешь пойти двумя путями. Я здесь, чтобы помочь тебе с выбором, если ты мне позволишь. Никогда не забывай об этом.~ ~Будь осторожна, моя дорогая. Внутри тебя происходит борьба, ты можешь пойти двумя путями. Я здесь, чтобы помочь тебе с выбором, если ты мне позволишь. Никогда не забывай об этом.~
@539  = ~(Ты молча киваешь. Сон тоже содержал предостережение о двух путях. Ты знаешь, что выберешь правильный, с помощью Сандры или без неё.)~
@540  = ~(Ты молча киваешь. Сон тоже содержал предостережение о двух путях. Ты знаешь, что выберешь правильный, но знать, что Сандра на твоей стороне, тебя обнадёживает.)~
@541  = ~(Ты молча киваешь. Сон тоже содержал предостережение о двух путях. Ты знаешь, что выберешь правильный.)~
@542  = ~Будь осторожен, мой дорогой. Внутри тебя происходит борьба, ты можешь пойти двумя путями. Или смерть Горайона, или образ его убийц привели к этой борьбе.~ ~Будь осторожна, моя дорогая. Внутри тебя происходит борьба, ты можешь пойти двумя путями. Или смерть Горайона, или образ его убийц привели к этой борьбе.~
@543  = ~Что бы это ни было, я знаю, что я не одинок с этим. Спасибо тебе за заботу. (Поцеловать её)~ ~Что бы это ни было, я знаю, что я не одинока с этим. Спасибо тебе за заботу. (Поцеловать её)~
@544  = ~Сандра, что бы это ни было, это моё дело и моя борьба. Спасибо за твою заботу, но ты мало что можешь с этим поделать. Просто позаботься о том, чтобы у тебя были наготове лечебные заклинания и советы, когда они мне понадобятся.~
@545  = ~Ой, ты весь в холодном поту. Ещё один дурной сон?~ ~Ой, ты вся в холодном поту. Ещё один дурной сон?~
@546  = ~Кровь, убийство, разрушение. Почему мне снятся эти сны? Это выходит далеко за рамки кровопролития, которое мы видим каждый день из-за навязанных нам боёв. Это что-то гораздо глубже. Почему?~
@547  = ~Что-то, или кто-то пытается с тобой поговорить? Пытается передать тебе сообщение?~
@548  = ~В первом сне это был Горайон... Но это был не он, это не мог быть он, исходя из того послания, которое он передал. На этот раз этот сумасшедший Мулахей - но опять же это была всего лишь маскировка. Этот кретин никогда бы не сказал тех слов, которые я услышал.~ ~В первом сне это был Горайон... Но это был не он, это не мог быть он, исходя из того послания, которое он передал. На этот раз этот сумасшедший Мулахей - но опять же это была всего лишь маскировка. Этот кретин никогда бы не сказал тех слов, которые я услышала.~
@549  = ~Да тот, кто не показывает своего истинного лица. Он или она использовали Горайона в первом сне и Мулахея сейчас. Но я в это не верю, слова этих подставных лиц не их собственные. Кто-то пытается втянуть меня на путь убийства и крови. Он пытается сказать мне, что это мой единственный выход.~
@550  = ~Ты поступаешь мудро, видя это таким образом. Это ложь. Кровь и убийства - это не твой путь, хотя мы не можем избежать битв и кровопролития, когда нам их навязывают. Но ты делаешь это не для того, чтобы получить от этого личную силу.~
@551  = ~Обними меня, Сандра, я так устал от всего этого.~ ~Обними меня, Сандра, я так устала от всего этого.~
@552  = ~Независимо от сообщения, я не вижу ничего плохого в том, каким путём мы идем. Это даёт мне силу, а не кровь и убийства.~
@553  = ~Независимо от сообщения, я не вижу ничего плохого в том, каким путём мы идем. Он кровавый, но также это даёт мне силу.~
@554  = ~(Сандра долго молча тебя обнимает.)~
@555  = ~Спасибо, моя любовь. Давай продолжим наш путь.~
@556  = ~Спасибо. (Ты освобождаешься от её объятий.) Давай продолжим наш путь.~
@557  = ~(Сандра молча кивает и пристально на тебя смотрит.)~
@558  = ~Давай продолжим наш путь.~
@559  = ~Спасибо. Давай продолжим наш путь.~
@560  = ~<CHARNAME>, look, those two pieces fit together, they seem to belong to the same cloth.~
@561  = ~ They do. Does that help you identify what is is or was?~
@562  = ~ What? They have been found very far apart from each other. However the pattern is unique, so they probably really belong to the same cloth.~
@563  = ~It looks somehow like the patterns that were on my bed cloth when I was very young back at my father's house in Waterdeep.~
@564  = ~ Incredible, how would pieces of your bed cloth come to places shattered throughout the Sword Coast? ~
@565  = ~Are you sure? I will not go out and chase phantoms all over Faerun for a bit of child's bed clothes.~
@566  = ~There was the mentioning of babies being in the traveller's party that was seen in both cases. But then again I am sure that I was never on the Sword Coast at this age. I only started travelling outside of Waterdeep when I was older and my father took me with him now and then.~
@567  = ~That would mean that you were not one of the children that were seen. But how did they get hold of your cloth. And then there are the hints directly to your interest. I am lost in this confusion.~
@568  = ~In my dream of Khalindra there was mentioning of the second child of your mother...~
@569  = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>, we still know too little. Let us put this aside for the moment unless we want to burst our heads in speculations.~
@570  = ~Hm, this child was born in Waterdeep one year after me but I did never see it. It was brought away very soon after its birth- to where I do not know.~
@571  = ~So if it was brought to the Sword Coast by this party of travellers who were ambushed and lost the cloth from your father's house? That would explain part of it, right?~
@572  = ~Right - part of it. Shar and Mystra both seem to have their hands in it too, they want me to find out about that child. ~
@573  = ~And what about you. You once told me you wanted to find out some things when you first started to travel with me. Is this part of your quest and search then?~
@574  = ~So are we now on a search for your mysterious brother or sister, a Bhaalspawn implanted to kill your mother and rob your father of his beloved wife. Do not forget that you joined me to follow my quest first.~
@575  = ~I believe that my search has pointed me to you in the first place. Your quest and mine seem to be somehow related. I am sure we will find the answers we both seek along our common path.~
@576  = ~We will not find that out by sitting here and talking. (Kiss her.) Answers are waiting to be found, let us move on.~
@577  = ~We will not find that out by sitting here and talking. Answers are waiting to be found, let us move on.~
@578  = ~This strange piece of cloth and the story in the Rashemen Journal seem to be connected, <CHARNAME>. ~
@579  = ~Both seem to point back to the same period, the period when we were babies as well, Sandrah.~
@580  = ~The cloth was probably torn to pieces during the bandit assault on the travellers. A Rashemen scout and a renegade drow were witnesses. A caravan leader goes mad in the event. And here are we, trying to solve an old riddle. Why?~
@581  = ~There is a connection to us, or at least to me. It is the pattern of this cloth that stirs up something in me, even if I cannot directly name it at this moment. And then we have these mysterious hints, as if I somebody or some power wants me to find these items. Of course I cannot ask you or our friends to help me with it. I myself do not really know what I could do other than to keep these things and hope that we will find more to fill the gaps in the puzzle.~
@582  = ~As it is the period of the lost part of my childhood, it soothes me to think that maybe we find out something about it as well. But anyway, let us move on for now.~
@583  = ~<CHARNAME>, you do not care for me in the same way that I care for you. I cannot trudge along by your side and be your mere companion with all the feelings my heart holds.~
@584  = ~I have stayed with you to accomplish this task for freeing Branwen. Now you have another competent cleric and fighter by your side and I am no longer needed. I have already asked Branwen to take care of you from now on. ~
@585  = ~No, Sandrah, no one leaves this group without my consent.~
@586  = ~If that is your final decision, Sandrah, I think I cannot hold you.~
@587  = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>, go and learn your lesson well. Maybe one day we meet again, who knows. One shall never give up hope. (She turns away quickly, her face wet with tears.) ~
@588  = ~So how do you feel with Branwen now, <CHARNAME>.~
@589  = ~Refreshing like a northern breeze. Do not deny it, you somehow seem to have wanted it that way?~
@590  = ~I am grateful you react in this way, Sandrah. I really would not know what to do if I had to decide between the two of you. A loss for all of us would be included for certain.~
@591  = ~I have the feeling we have all gained something very special. I am glad that you - somehow, eh, in your kind but steadfast way - have encouraged me to go this far with her.~
@592  = ~I am so happy, <CHARNAME>, I was a bit afraid you would not have the courage to follow your heart's course consequently. This is an experience we should enjoy as long as we can.~
@593  = ~You sound a bit strange now? You seem to love her so much yourself and still I sense a bit of reserve at this moment.~
@594  = ~You are right in both. Yes, I love her and then again I am a bit afraid of her final decision.~
@595  = ~You mean she will in the end decide between you and me instead of accepting her love for both of us?~
@596  = ~Even if she decides for me in the end, that will change nothing of my love for you, Sandrah.~
@597  = ~If finally her love for you will be stronger than her love for me, I am still content it will not affect our relationship.~
@598  = ~That is not what I fear. This is not the decision she will have to make. It is the choice between us or Tempus. Her god requires the total devotion of his priests. Our arguments that to fight for the good and the loved ones should be pleasing to Tempus, may not be strong enough in the end. I do not want to be a doom sayer on this happy day, but I do not want you to be completely unprepared.~
@599  = ~And my priestess of Mystra? Are you maybe trying to prepare me for something in that respect as well?~
@600  = ~(Laughs) No chance, <CHARNAME>, it needs more than even a whole pantheon of gods to separate me from you.~
@601  = ~We have found the book we need - but maybe it is worth to look further to find where those drow and spiders may have leaked into the mines.~
@602  = ~You are right, we will not let our continuous efforts to keep the mines operating be in vain if they have this threat from below open all the times.~
@603  = ~No, we can't keep on saving these mines every tenday. We must take care of our own mission now.~
@604  = ~So they really exist, the followers of the Dark Maiden, Eilistraee. And they have really achieved to live in peace across the races.~
@605  = ~A fascinating woman, very unlike any of the drow we have met, including refugees on the surface. I am afraid my own knowledge on that specific subject is not very good.~
@606  = ~The Dark Lady herself is a child of Corellon Larethian and Araushnee - later known as Lolth the Queen of the Spider Pits. Regardless of her heritage Eilistraee became a good goddess of the moon, dance, song, the sword and the hunt who grants her followers special abilities to help them survive. They are usually drow who decided (or were forced to) leave the Underdark. However, not only drow may become Sword Dancers. There are also surface elves and half-elves among them.  ~
@607  = ~They often live in forests or abandoned ruins which become both their shelter and temples. Eilistraee and Mystra are sometimes worshipped together and lore has it that a temple exists deep below Waterdeep's Undermountain.~
@608  = ~This priestess somehow appeared to me as a dark counterpart to you.~
@609  = ~She was quite brave to make this appearance in front of a party who had just stopped a High Priestess of Lolth and her heavy forces.~
@610  = ~She was quite brave to make this appearance in front of a party who had just stopped a Bregan D'aerthe activity.~
@611  = ~(Smiles) I take this as the compliment it was meant to be.~
@612  = ~Eilistraee is peaceful but her disciples are no cowards. You have to be very strong to follow the path they must follow.~
@613  = ~Будь осторожен, <CHARNAME>, там, на мосту - красный волшебник, самая страшная чума, которой Мистра позволяет обитать в Фаэруне.~ ~Будь осторожна, <CHARNAME>, там, на мосту - красный волшебник, самая страшная чума, которой Мистра позволяет обитать в Фаэруне.~
@614  = ~Успокойся, Сандра, если твоя собственная богиня допускает их существование, тебе не следует судить их сильнее, чем она.~
@615  = ~Ты меня удивляешь, Сандра. Обычно ты самая довольная и снисходительная из всех. Я не ожидал, что ты можешь кого-то так резко осуждать.~ ~Ты меня удивляешь, Сандра. Обычно ты самая довольная и снисходительная из всех. Я не ожидала, что ты можешь кого-то так резко осуждать.~
@616  = ~Моя богиня терпит их интриги, и, вероятно, ты ждёшь, что я буду поступать так же. Но моя позиция ясна, силы Мистры нужно использовать для созидания чего-то положительного. Красных волшебников интересует только сила, которую они могут получить от магии - они не заботятся о добре и зле, и работают на тех, от кого ждут силы и богатства.~
@617  = ~Думаю, моя советница, в данном случае мне лучше доверять собственному мнению. Твоё окрашено неприязнью к красным волшебникам в принципе.~
@618  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is an old hut in this area, that is no longer occupied. It is not extremely comfortable, but it is a nice dry shelter nevertheless.~
@619  = ~I like that promising sparkle in your eye, Sandrah. I seldom can read your mind, but at this moment I think I can. (Kiss her.) Let us not stand here idle but go to find it.~
@620  = ~An old hut in an area beset by Ogres. The true love nest for the die-hard adventurer. But with you, Sandrah, it may turn into a cozy little island of peace. Let's see.~
@621  = ~My interest in old huts in an area beset by Ogres is below zero. And...I recognise that look in your eyes. My answer is no.~
@622  = ~Now that we are sure the area is safe, <CHARNAME>, are you still in the mood to visit that little hut again (She looks at you with that special little-girl-look that is almost irresistible.)~
@623  = ~Sorry, Sandrah, but somehow the moment is gone. Those are the ways of our adventurer's life. ~
@624  = ~Do you think a few ogres can spoil my mood when it comes to my love for you. I am more hungry for your sweet lips than I even was before.~
@625  = ~I already told you that I'm not interested in another of your advances.~
@626  = ~*Sandrah is so very sweet even when she sulks, you cannot restrain yourself from embracing her and diving into a long kiss on her willing lips.*~
@627  = ~Here is something to help you for the moment. I cannot see you collapse on the way to our nest. (She revives your body with an electrifying assault on your hungry lips.)~
@628  = ~(Sigh) If you would only know what you miss...~
@629  = ~You are tired for today and our cosy little hut is nearby, you remember it?~
@630  = ~You are right. But then, I am not too tired. Let us go there but I do not need my sleep immediately (blink at her.)~
@631  = ~You are so right. I could fall asleep within the next five steps. Let us quickly go there.~
@632  = ~You are right. Better than to sleep out in the open.~
@633  = ~(She gives you a passionate kiss while gently touching your earlobes and caressing your neck) I can make your tiredness go away for some time. You will see we can accomplish something sweet before you totally collapse.~
@634  = ~You have the healing touch for every occasion, my sweetheart.~
@635  = ~<CHARNAME>, только посмотри на эти блики света, танцующие на воде! Пойдёмте, друзья, поплескемся прямо...~
@636  = ~(Постепенно твои чувства возвращаются к реальности.)~
@637  = ~Солнце начинает садиться, мне становится холодно. Жаль, что нам нужно идти. (Целует тебя) Эй, все, не забывайте своих вещей.~
@638  = ~Скажи мне, когда ты будешь готов идти.~ ~Скажи мне, когда ты будешь готова идти.~
@639  = ~Мы готовы идти?~
@640  = ~Подожди минуточку, ещё не все восстановили экипировку.~
@641  = ~Печально, но это так, нам нужно идти дальше.~
@642  = ~Not astonishing that magic leads to unwanted results when it falls into the hands of such as Shandalar.~
@643  = ~Whatever. If you were expecting something like that, why did you let me lead us into this trap? ~
@644  = ~You knew that mage and let me take his quest nonetheless. I know you well enough to trust that you had your reasons for it? ~
@645  = ~I do not expect this contraption to be a real danger for us in the end, <CHARNAME>, just another challenge to make us more experienced and stronger as a group.~
@646  = ~So, yes, I know a bit about the likes of Shandalar and my position as a cleric of Mystra towards them.~
@647  = ~They are using the powers granted by Mystra just like you do. It looks like your goddess does not really do much to control the misuse of the magic she provides.~
@648  = ~From what I understand from my studies back at Candlekeep, your goddess provides mages of any colour and kind with her gifts and cares little about the results that her disciples produce.~
@649  = ~You are not to blame for the misconception of Mystra, and many people would share your view. On first sight she may appear as a careless goddess, who grants great powers to good and evil alike and cares little about what damage may be done by some. She appears a bit the opposite of the ever-vigilant Helm, who likes to control each and every whim on Faerun.~
@650  = ~But? I assume there is a *but*, Sandrah.~
@651  = ~Right, you would not expect me to follow a goddess of the nature just described. Mystra is a tolerant goddess as are her priests, such as I. My intention is to help and heel and support those who try to do good - those like you. Things are not always black or white, you surely know. Not every little bit of error needs the immediate intervention of a god, like a Helmite would make us believe.~
@652  = ~In the end, many of those who try to achieve great power and riches at expense of their fellow beings by misusing Mystra's gift end up like those we meet right here. They entangle themselves in their own traps, they put themselves far outside of the community of others and they end alone and helpless out in the cold.~
@653  = ~For the rest, well, true followers of Mystra like me and my father go out and deal with them. And we encourage others, even those who do not rely on magic resources, to stand up against those who err too far from what is still acceptable.~
@654  = ~So Mystra in the end helps those who first take their own courage to do something and decide to act against what is wrong.~
@655  = ~You are not supposed to sit down and hope that help would come from the gods. But if you decide to act along the right course, you will receive the help and encouragement you need.~
@656  = ~Then you are a good priestess of Mystra, as I never once saw you pray to your goddess, but I often felt you encourage me and the group to gather up our courage and act. -
Which means we will stop talking now and fight our way out of here! ~
@657  = ~A shrouded way of logic, I'd say. So, let's fight our way out of here! ~
@658  = ~<CHARNAME>, we are near the old entry to the forgotten Waterdeep road. With the help of this map I can lead us to where the road starts.~
@659  = ~Waterdeep, fantastic, what are we still waiting for. I think we have all deserved a little time out after our recent adventures.~
@660  = ~Let us get a little rest at the inn and prepare for the journey. It may not be without some danger. We will come back here again to start to Waterdeep. ~
@661  = ~Of course you are all invited to my father's house. I can hardly await to see my home again - with you, with all of you!~
@662  = ~Come, let me lead on with this map...~
@663  = ~Of course you are all invited to my father's house. I can hardly await to see my home again - with you, with all of you.~
@664  = ~Just return to west of the Inn and tell me when you are ready.~
@665  = ~Welcome to my home town, <CHARNAME>. May I give you some initial introduction to this area.~
@666  = ~Hey, I'm an adventurer by now, I like to explore things myself.~
@667  = ~The City of Splendour is quite large, your aid is much welcome.~
@668  = ~Just tell me what is in our immediate surrounding.~
@669  = ~We have arrived in the south western ward of town, centred around the Temples of Waukeen, Siamorphe, and Sharess. Here we find a lot of entertainment and - (laughs) - a warm thermal bath house in the south.~
@670  = ~Thanks, let us take a look at all that.~
@671  = ~I know about Waukeen, the god of commerce and trade, but who are those other two you mentioned?~
@672  = ~Where else can we go from here?~
@673  = ~Sharess actually has no temple but a festhall to worship dance, music...all carnal pleasures, she is the goddess of Hedonism.~
@674  = ~Siamorphe is a local demi-goddess, her portfolio is the Divine Right by which the noble leaders rule the masses responsibly and she is thus worshipped by those with inherited wealth and power.~
@675  = ~You may ask me any time for assistance again.~
@676  = ~Thank you for that beautiful evening, <CHARNAME>. We all could use a little break from our usual adventures, right? I love you for it. ~
@677  = ~Yes, dear, it was some fun. I almost forgot what is awaiting us again now. ~
@678  = ~My father's house is not far away. Before the road gets us back again, I would really like to show it to you. It is still a very special place to me. It is home.~
@679  = ~(She takes your hand lightly.) And there is my own room in there. On the large bed I was dreaming my girl's dreams of romance and the hero that would come to rescue me. And now I dream of something else to do there...~
@680  = ~I can hardly wait to share the place and its memories with you, Sandrah.~
@681  = ~Once we have found this villain Khattark, I would be more than willing to share the place and its memories with you, darling.~
@682  = ~Who could resist a visit to the famous Elminster's house.~
@683  = ~<CHARNAME>, time has run out to let my father wait for your assistance up there at the Friendly Arm. Elminster does not call us in such a manner just to let us run some errands for him. ~
@684  = ~As you find your other tasks more pressing than his plea, there is no other decision for me than to go and help him alone on behalf of the group. ~
@685  = ~Such is your loyalty, Sandrah? Go if you must. ~
@686  = ~I see the dilemma we are in. I think we need to split the group for the time being. You may go to assist your father while we continue to pursue the task at hand. This is not an easy decision and please explain our situation to your father. We will meet again when both our tasks are done. ~
@687  = ~Wait a minute, Sandrah. We will go to the Inn at this instance. ~
@688  = ~You have proven yourself a competent leader for our group so far. Even if not perfect, you are learning more day after day. I respect your decision, it is for the group and our goals. I am not so selfish as to complain.~
@689  = ~For this very moment however I have to follow my father. May Mystra's blessing be with you, <CHARNAME>. I cannot say if we meet again but my hope is that we do. Farewell.~
@690  = ~(She does not turn away quick enough - you still get a glimpse of the sadness on her face.) ~
@691  = ~(Your mind has been spinning around some of the recent encounters you had with different people, who all seem to know Sandrah. Or to be more precise - her father. A mighty mage from Waterdeep. You realize that the conversations always have changed the topic when the talk came to Sandrah's famous father.)~
@692  = ~(You have read a lot in the Candlekeep library. At least enough to know about the mysterious mage from Waterdeep who is famous throughout the realms. And what about that old mage who seems to follow your traces and who seems to know about all your deeds? You are sure now: They are one and the same.)~
@693  = ~(You clear your throat as you approach Sandrah who looks at you expectantly.) ~
@694  = ~Dear <CHARNAME>, so shy? What lays so heavy on your mind? (She smiles encouraging.) ~
@695  = ~Yes, Sandrah, there is something on my mind that keeps worrying me. Your heritage, em, I mean your father...~
@696  = ~Em...you look lovely, Sandrah. (Give her a quick kiss on the cheek.) ~
@697  = ~Em...never mind.~
@698  = ~Lovely liar. You do not need to be afraid to talk to me about anything. Let me help you then. You wanted to talk about my father, right?~
@699  = ~Your heritage, em, I mean your father...it worries me that everybody seems to know something that maybe I have missed...~
@700  = ~Understandable. My father worries a lot of people. But those are people different from you. You do not need to be worried by him, <CHARNAME>. (She takes your hand to walk beside you as you continue to talk.)~
@701  = ~Your father then - it is Elminster himself, isn't it? ~
@702  = ~I am Elminster's only daughter. ~
@703  = ~This is not a secret - as you have experienced through the people we have met during our travels together.~
@704  = ~How could I have been so blind? You must really think I am a fool and you secretly laugh about me? ~
@705  = ~And you tried to hide this very fact from me? Why? What is your game here, Elminster's daughter? --- You are his spy!! ~
@706  = ~Wow, that explains a lot. This must be quite a burden for a young girl who wants to find her own way in life. ~
@707  = ~You are a liar and manipulator through and through - and now I know why!~
@708  = ~(Sandrah stops, still holding your hand, and faces you. She looks you straight in the eyes with this enigmatic smile of hers.)~
@709  = ~I never tried to hide the fact I am his daughter from you. And I never on the other hand tried to impress you with it. I thought, when the time was right, we would just talk about it.~
@710  = ~But why this secrecy? ~
@711  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is and was no secret! Our relationship is build on trust, so I will always be honest to you. Just some things need their real moment and their time to be ready for talk.~
@712  = ~Now, I just wanted you to take me for what I AM, not what or who my father is. In the same way I accept you for what you are and what you do -  ~
@713  = ~- and not for what your heritage may be. (The last part was delivered almost as a whisper.) ~
@714  = ~I understand. I am sorry, Sandrah, I apologise for having given you the impression that I have any doubt in your loyalty and honesty. Just the fact to have the mighty Elminster's daughter holding my hand right now is so overwhelming...~
@715  = ~I think I understand you in a way. But are you not a little bit withholding things from me? ~
@716  = ~You have an experienced way to make all your lies sound so plausible, I have to admit that.~
@717  = ~And this is exactly what I wanted to avoid. I AM SANDRAH. Yes, I am also Elminster's daughter - but I want you to take me as Sandrah and nothing else. I love my father dearly, but I am not his shadow. I learned from him and I try to follow his example. I even help him a bit in his work from time to time according to my abilities.~
@718  = ~But I have a mind and a life of my own. I go my own way through life - and that way is with you...(She embraces you now with both her arms and gives you another of these deep looks.) <CHARNAME>. ~
@719  = ~(You put your arms around her and kiss her.) It is Sandrah I kiss, not Elminster's daughter. ~
@720  = ~Yes, you have proven that while by my side already, Sandrah. I can imagine that being Elminster's daughter can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. Come, Sandrah, I am glad to have you with me for your own virtues, not your father's. ~
@721  = ~(You manage to escape her grip.) You have convinced me for the moment. Being his daughter is not an easy thing. I just hope I make no mistake by trusting you too much.~
@722  = ~(Сандра с отвращением счищает кровь со своего оружия.)~
@723  = ~Как ты узнала заранее, что это был наёмный убийца?~
@724  = ~Интуиция. Его чрезмерно дружеские слова были подозрительными, разве нет?~
@725  = ~Тот, кто отправил их за тобой, знает, что ты больше не в Кендлкипе. ~
@726  = ~Двое из них уже были в Кендлкипе до того, как мы с Горайоном ушли. Кто бы ни послал их, он знает, что они уже мертвы. Существо в доспехах, убившее Горайона, знает, что я ушёл из дома. Нам нужно больше фактов.~ ~Двое из них уже были в Кендлкипе до того, как мы с Горайоном ушли. Кто бы ни послал их, он знает, что они уже мертвы. Существо в доспехах, убившее Горайона, знает, что я ушла из дома. Нам нужно больше фактов.~
@727  = ~Девушка, ты констатируешь очевидное. Есть мысли поглубже?~
@728  = ~Тот, кто убил твоего отца, или один из них, или он тот, кто отправляет их сейчас. Это означает, что он не знает точно, где ты находишься, или он слишком занят, чтобы самому пойти за тобой.~
@729  = ~Во всяком случае, Джахейра и Халид, вероятно, ждут тебя в гостинице.~
@730  = ~Да, пойдем туда. (Внезапно тебе приходит в голову, что ты упоминал лишь о *друзьях, ждущих тебя в Дружеской Руке*, никогда не называя имён. Откуда их знает Сандра?)~ ~Да, пойдем туда. (Внезапно тебе приходит в голову, что ты упоминала лишь о *друзьях, ждущих тебя в Дружеской Руке*, никогда не называя имён. Откуда их знает Сандра?)~
@731  = ~<CHARNAME>, пожалуйста, нам нужно забрать Имоен. Не оставляй её вот так. Я знаю, ты слишком заботишься о ней, чтобы потерять её - как и она о тебе.~
@732  = ~Ваши пути идут вместе, поверь мне.~
@733  = ~Я так рада, что ты будешь с нами, Имоен. Я Сандра.~
@734  = ~Ты верен своим друзьям, <CHARNAME>. Мы постоим за тебя, когда тебе потребуетя помощь и забота. И тебе НУЖНА помощь!~ ~Ты верна своим друзьям, <CHARNAME>. Мы постоим за тебя, когда тебе потребуетя помощь и забота. И тебе НУЖНА помощь!~
@735  = ~Берегись, <CHARNAME>, этот пояс проклят. Не вздумай надеть его, если не хочешь изменить свой пол на противоположный. Я бы предпочла, чтобы ты оставался таким, какой есть. (Шёпотом: ты мне и правда больше нравишься таким, какой есть.)~ ~Берегись, <CHARNAME>, этот пояс проклят. Не вздумай надеть его, если не хочешь изменить свой пол на противоположный. Я бы предпочла, чтобы ты оставалась такой, какая есть. (Шёпотом: ты мне и правда больше нравишься такой, какая есть.)~
@736  = ~Ты довольно много знаешь о тех вещах, которые не видны невооруженным глазом. Как так?~
@737  = ~Кроме моего обучения искусству Мистры, у меня есть этот особенный экземпляр Истории Фаэруна Элминстера, который, как ты видел, я читаю всякий раз, когда позволяет время. Так что, если я не знаю, что это за вещь сразу, велики шансы, что я смогу идентифицировать её с помощью этого фолианта.~
@738  = ~С тобой на каждом шагу ждут новые сюрпризы. (Ты улыбаешься ей) Я постараюсь максимально использовать твои таланты.~
@739  = ~Ты хорошо подготовилась к этому приключению, Сандра. Интересно, что ещё ты знаешь...~
@740  = ~Ты слышал, <CHARNAME>, девочка говорила о пещере с адскими воняющими существами. Я уверена, что наша цель близко.~ ~Ты слышала, <CHARNAME>, девочка говорила о пещере с адскими воняющими существами. Я уверена, что наша цель близко.~
@741  = ~Тогда нам лучше подготовиться, это будет непростая битва. ~
@742  = ~Хм, детские фантазии, ты слышала, как она говорила о семи жизнях своей кошки. Я думаю, она несколько глупа, чтобы ей верить.~
@743  = ~Да, я тоже так думаю. Сначала демонический свиток, а теперь этот ребёнок. Всё совпадает, должно быть, мы очень близко.~
@744  = ~Похоже, на этот раз логово демона скрывается не за водопадом, <CHARNAME>. Но я всё равно думаю, что мы, должно быть, близко. Возможно, та девочка что-то заметила.~
@745  = ~(Ты следуешь взглядом за её указательным пальцем и видишь маленькую девочку, стоящую над водопадом.) Давай её спросим.~
@746  = ~Are we really relying on children and their babbling to find a mighty demon? ~
@747  = ~Someone obviously has killed this cat. And this someone smells pretty much like the hellish stench we encountered at the other lair.~
@748  = ~I will be damned if you are right again. ~
@749  = ~A fun fair, <CHARNAME>, we have not had much amusement for quite a while.~
@750  = ~And I do not feel much like having some now. Sandrah, just consider why we are here and don't play the little girl at the amusement park role, he.~
@751  = ~Counsellor, I agree, our mission is grave and our prospect is dark. As one elf I know may say, we are doomed and may not even see tomorrow. So why not have some fun.~
@752  = ~Maybe that fortune teller over there may have some method of divination to apply on that vampiric sword we have found?~
@753  = ~Oh, my lovely tease. Has somebody told you already that your optimism can brighten up any gloom - yes, I guess you heard that before. Let us enjoy ourselves then. ~
@754  = ~How about riding that Ferris wheel. It is fun and we also get a perspective of this whole town from above, which may be quite useful in our coming investigations?~
@755  = ~Great! I have never seen such a thing in my life. And combining the useful with the playful, a great idea.~
@756  = ~As one elf I know may say, we are doomed and may not even see tomorrow. Let us ask this fortune teller about the way we die then - or about the love that will save us from such a fate.~
@757  = ~Interesting...this must be the place. (Sandrah closes her tome and stares inquisitively at a haystack near the mighty castle wall.)~
@758  = ~Haha, have you found the needle we look for in this haystack?~
@759  = ~It must be more than an ordinary haystack if it is mentioned in your all-knowing book?~
@760  = ~Many haystacks contain a needle that someone might be looking for, <CHARNAME>.~
@761  = ~Anyway this one seems to hide a secret passage that I found mentioned here on these pages. It is said that Balduran himself used a secret entrance in the well guarded walls of the city if he wanted to sneak in and out on some very private occasions.~
@762  = ~A love tunnel? Let us take a look.~
@763  = ~The prospect of a lighter way of travelling instead of trudging dusty roads is very appealing...~
@764  = ~Could a skilled disciple of Mystra make some use of what we have gathered today?~
@765  = ~He?~
@766  = ~We would lose much of the landscape and its sights by that, haha.~
@767  = ~(Sandrah seems to be lost in her thoughts without paying much attention to your responses.)~
@768  = ~A sky ship would draw too much attention to a party that better operates more discreet...but those formulas in the book...integrated with my parcels abilities...hm, hm, hm...~
@769  = ~Anything in your considerations you like to share with us, Sandrah?~
@770  = ~(Leave her to her musings knowing she will come out with her results when the time is ripe - which may be in quite a long while with her.)~
@771  = ~Ooops, was I thinking aloud, dear?~
@772  = ~Oh, I was considering a *long term project* for which I just found a little piece today. Nothing yet ripe enough to reveal. (Smiles at you.)~
@773  = ~You and your secrets. I know, if it helps the company you'll come out with it soon enough.~
@774  = ~It seems that everything we had deducted so far is actually true. Rieltar and the Iron Throne have lost control of the operation. No one seems to really care about us any more.~
@775  = ~No one except for Sarevok, that is. His plans in deed seem to be quite different from those of the Iron Throne's leaders - or we have disturbed him so much, that he somehow lost control himself.~
@776  = ~I am sure we have added our bit to the current disturbance. Another part of it nevertheless is internal trouble, probably clearer to us than to the Iron Throne's leaders themselves. They seem to be still unaware of Sarevok's true nature and intentions.~
@777  = ~Let us seize the moment and move further up. But carefully. We have heard about those mages on the fifth floor. We have experienced this Winski, so we have to expect some powerful resistance up there. ~
@778  = ~Hm?~
@779  = ~That was quite a fight! What is *Hm*?~
@780  = ~That was not what we have expected. Quite some fight, but just mercenaries nonetheless. Our real foe are not here it seems.~
@781  = ~Haven't we heard a rumour before, that they might be at Candlekeep?~
@782  = ~Let us seek the rooms for any evidence we may produce to Eltan and the authorities. And for any trace of these bastards.~
@783  = ~Do you think they will let you back into Candlekeep under these circumstances, <CHARNAME>?~
@784  = ~I doubt it. The monks are extremely strict in their rules and the fate of the Sword Coast outside is pretty remote for them. We must find some other way to gain access.~
@785  = ~I hope they will if the Dukes themselves sent us officially. But I doubt the Dukes will do that on the poor evidence we can produce. Rieltar has taken everything with him.~
@786  = ~It is best to talk to Duke Eltan in private about our findings. You are right, the Dukes as such will require more facts and evidence to act or to let us act on their behalf. But Eltan may be able to get us some means of access for Candlekeep so we can continue our research.~
@787  = ~The paper chase continues then to the next station. ~
@788  = ~I would not take this step so lightly, <CHARNAME>. From this letter of Sarevok I sense something strange and cunning is afoot. Why does he lie to his father about your defeat? Why does he bring in the Zhentarim as scapegoats? He says he will *not* come to Candlekeep because of some quarrel in his troops. That is another lie as we have defeated them and he knows it.~
@789  = ~Hm, a whole package of lies to his father and his superior in the throne. And why shouldn't he go to Candlekeep at this important stage of the operation. Does he wait for us here?~
@790  = ~Clever questions, <CHARNAME>.~
@791  = ~(Smile) I am learning daily - from the best, from you.~
@792  = ~And has my clever counsellor the answers?~
@793  = ~Does any of this help us with our case?~
@794  = ~First, I think he will go to Candlekeep but he does not want his father to know it.~
@795  = ~Second, we have heard that he probably wants to take over the Iron Throne leadership himself pretty soon these days.~
@796  = ~Third, he wants his father and the other leaders think that we are no longer a danger to be taken into account.~
@797  = ~Fourth, the thrones forces and mercenaries that we have not yet destroyed are here in Baldur's Gate while the leaders set off to Candlekeep. Alone to keep the important meeting secret.~
@798  = ~Fifth, Candlekeep and its secluded walls will keep off any spying eyes from what will really happen there! Sarevok will eliminate the Iron Throne leaders, probably shifting the blame to the party they are supposed to meet there, and return as sole survivor.~
@799  = ~Hm. Hm?~
@800  = ~You are not convinced of this interpretation?~
@801  = ~Something else?~
@802  = ~More or less I agree to your conclusion. Only - I have the feeling we are missing some small detail that might in the end prove to be important. Why, for example, does he lie about our elimination? ~
@803  = ~For some reason he wants us to be there as well.~
@804  = ~It is doubly a trap, a trap for his father and a trap for us. But how?~
@805  = ~The meeting is faked. There is no party from the south for negotiation. But there will be us. Does he expect us to do his dirty job for him?~
@806  = ~We might as well turn that against him and warn the Iron Throne leaders about him. But we will only find out by going there - and avoiding the trap as we know that it exists.~
@807  = ~Even if it was an admirably clever executed theft, I feel not so well to have robbed the people of Leonardo's famous invention, unless you convince me it is of better use to us than it is exposed for public admiration in the Hall of Wonders.~
@808  = ~You would admit then, it does not belong into a museum if it could be useful still?~
@809  = ~Hey, we have just proven that we are the most potent adventuring band on the Sword Coast. Does that mean nothing to you, Sandrah?~
@810  = ~It was just gathering dust in that place. You heard that gnome wants to use it in the way it was once designed to be used by Leonardo himself.~
@811  = ~The purpose of exposing it there, as far as I can see, is to inspire young imaginative people to follow the science and maybe invent things like Leonardo did that may be of benefit for the population.~
@812  = ~Which means, any more practical use of it should then receive your approval.~
@813  = ~A replica accompanied by some explanatory words can suit a similar purpose then, but only the real one can be used for an actual purpose.~
@814  = ~No.~
@815  = ~I guess you are right - in principle. The purpose of exposing it there, as far as I can see, is to inspire young imaginative people to follow the science and maybe invent things like Leonardo did that may be of benefit for the population. A replica accompanied by some explanatory words can suit a similar purpose then, but only the real one can be used for an actual purpose. Only I doubt this dwarf had more in his mind than to just sell it.~
@816  = ~Hm. Then maybe I just should keep it for myself. It is very useful to observe bathing girls on a faraway beach...haha.~
@817  = ~Hm. Then maybe I just should keep it to myself. It is very useful to us to observe handsome bathing males on a faraway beach...haha.~
@818  = ~I believe the guy, Sandrah, those dwarves are always curious and practical people. Perhaps we contribute to a great discovery this way.~
@819  = ~A powerful tool in our situation if we need to observe a dangerous enemy from a safe distance. Or just to scan a waste landscape for possible trouble. I believe Leonardo would agree to such a use of his tool. Let's forget the dwarf and just keep it.~
@820  = ~May I have that telescope for a minute, please?~
@821  = ~Sure - do you want to stargaze?~
@822  = ~Exactly. (She searches the starlit sky until she finds what she was looking for.) There they are indeed, in the same section of the sky, bright as it was reported.~
@823  = ~Are you looking for those two new stars I heard talking of? Some superstitious people claim they represent new gods to rise. I never would have guessed you belong among them!~
@824  = ~Those new stars that signal the arrival of new gods in the pantheon? Does Bhaal have a constellation representing him?~
@825  = ~(Smiles) I am not superstitious although many claim truth on the fact that each re-incarnation of Mystra is represented by a new star in her belt. But a new one? Now? As her priestess and granddaughter I would know such a thing.~
@826  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, as a healer and historian I am interested how such beliefs are fuelled, how observations made by mortals turn into myth or prejudice. Like those two stars.~
@827  = ~What about that second one - Does Bhaal have a constellation representing him?~
@828  = ~No, unless you take the blackness in the absence of any star or light as his dark domain. That second new one is of a different nature, very bright. Here look at it yourself.~
@829  = ~(You take a look at the respective section of the nightly sky and immediately find the two constellations.) This one is Mystra's Belt, sure. What is the other constellation?~
@830  = ~(She has taken a piece of parchment and a quilt from her pack and puts five dots in the same constellation you had seen above on it. She then draws some connecting lines so you see a symbol that you are sure to have seen before.)~
@831  = ~I feel like having seen that symbol before, some decoration, some old book...it is not a symbol of Bhaal, it is too beautiful for that.~
@832  = ~No it is not Bhaal, almost the opposite. It is a Certar, a rune symbol found in the heritage of the older races of Faerun - it represents *Hope*.~
@833  = ~A new god bringing new hope... (sigh)... we could use him - or her.~
@834  = ~I sense a very strong presence of the Weave, <CHARNAME>. It seems to be coming from one of these nearby houses.~
@835  = ~Your mystic powers astonish me every time. And they seem to get stronger with the experience and use during our travel. What do you propose?~
@836  = ~Something positive or something dangerous, can you tell that?~
@837  = ~I cannot sense anything imminent dangerous with it. If you like, we can just saturate our curiosity and explore the surrounding buildings.~
@838  = ~A very powerful but blind orc shaman and his guide, hm.~
@839  = ~Any idea what they were searching?~
@840  = ~Obviously they lost their way. Or do you have some deeper insight?~
@841  = ~Not much more than what they revealed by their words. They were Clan Orcs, meaning they come from the great orc clan nations far in the north - not to be compared with the orcs we encounter around here. They search for a godchild, but not one of the Bhaalspawns. Either your blood or Sarevok's has guided them to this town. But it was an error.~
@842  = ~Don't laugh at me and don't ask me why - but I have the strong feeling we will see them again.~
@843  = ~I do neither. I think you are right. You demi-gods have a tendency to find each other as you all move on paths set aside from the masses. It is an orc girl they look for and maybe we will find her one of these days.~
@844  = ~You are not like him and you never could have been. I am blessed I am not in her place.~
@845  = ~Sandrah?~
@846  = ~That poor Tamoko, cursed to love the wrong Bhaalspawn like I am blessed to follow the right one. Her story has confirmed everything we have learned about Sarevok so far.~
@847  = ~And such a fate could have been mine, had not Gorion and your father had their hands shielding over me. And Elminster's daughter in the times of ordeal.~
@848  = ~That Sarevok is a fool and that will be his downfall.~
@849  = ~But she also revealed, that the way for you or him was not set but a path to be chosen and a path that can be altered even later on by redemption.~
@850  = ~One thing is strange however. He sees himself as my brother and me as his family. It is his prime reason to be after me like that?~
@851  = ~One of his many errors. He is alone in his lust for power, as we heard from poor Tamoko, nobody has ever helped him to discover the true nature of his heritage. He only had this Othlor Winski that fed him with just the terms about the evil aspect of being a Bhaalspawn. And the only interest he has in his siblings is to eliminate them as possible rivals to the Throne of Bhaal.~
@852  = ~You sound as if you somehow understand and forgive him.~
@853  = ~You think, I may have ended in his place under different circumstances. Does that make you sound so forgiving?~
@854  = ~It is not for me to either condemn or forgive him, <CHARNAME>. That is your decision if it is to decide for any of us.~
@855  = ~You have been my counsellor and my lover through all of this. So I may rightfully ask you for your opinion of that.~
@856  = ~You have been my counsellor through all of this. So I may rightfully ask you for your opinion of that.~
@857  = ~This venture has been our common one since the beginning, it is not my decision alone that counts here. You have heard it once again from Tamoko, this is not a *family affair*, millions of lives on Toril are at stake here.~
@858  = ~For the survival of the Realms, his defeat is as sure as his death.~
@859  = ~I respect you for every word that you have said. Yes, we cannot just decide for us here, but for the fate of the Sword Coast and the Realms. It will all depend on Sarevok once we have him tracked down. When he sees his defeat, it will be him to give us the evidence on which we will decide.~
@860  = ~So be it.~
@861  = ~I apologise, <CHARNAME>, that had to be your decision not mine. I over acted.~
@862  = ~I am not sure I understand what was really going on. Those poor fishermen asking for our help were really murderers and thieves? And how could you know?~
@863  = ~I hope you have a good explanation for it.~
@864  = ~I knew because I saw it in my father's shard. I will tell you about it some other time.~
@865  = ~Whatever. I am leading this party and we follow my decisions. As you have apologised already, let us move on.~
@866  = ~Whatever told you, it looks you were right. I did not know that Mystra was a goddess to threaten people that way. Any idea how to finish this, now that we have this strange bowl?~
@867  = ~It is neither Mystra's habit nor mine to threaten people. I am sorry I let these vile men get me so angry. As to the bowl, we should give it to the priestess daughter when we meet her. She must be around here, along the river somewhere.~
@868  = ~<CHARNAME>, посмотри сюда, я предлагаю взять образец этого испорченного железа с собой в Нашкель, может быть, они узнают, что вызывает его раcпад, и что-нибудь с этим поделать. Возможно, даже Таэром с его знанием железа может быть полезен.~
@869  = ~Да, мы должны даже осмотреть этих существ здесь, внизу, у них могут быть какие-нибудь свидетельства того, что они использовали, чтобы нанести ущерб.~
@870  = ~Было бы лучше, если бы мы нашли какое-нибудь пригодное для использования железо для Таэрома и Брегара, вместо того, чтобы загружать наши рюкзаки каким-то мусором, моя *советчица*.~
@871  = ~Пожалуйста, <CHARNAME>, удели мне минутку твоего времени.~
@872  = ~Конечно, Сандра, ты в последнее время была немного молчалива.~
@873  = ~(Вздохнуть) Да?~
@874  = ~В магическом кристалле моего отца незадолго до того, как я ушла из дома на Побережье Меча, я случайно увидела кое-что, что меня беспокоит. Теперь, когда мы покинули дикую местность, я думаю, мы можем что-то с этим сделать.~
@875  = ~Я видела другую священницу, высокую и белокурую, так что я думаю, она, должно быть, откуда-то с севера. В моём видении она была с очень неприятным магом, и они из-за чего-то сильно поссорились.~
@876  = ~Как бы там ни было, маг наложил заклинание "Плоть в камень" на бедную девушку, и она окаменела. Она, должно быть, сейчас подобна статуе и сильно страдает от этого. Пожалуйста, <CHARNAME>, нам нужно найти её и освободить от этого заклинания.~
@877  = ~Сандра, у нас своих проблем хватает, и последнее, что мы сделаем, это станем прочёсывать Побережье Меча в поисках священниц с севера, попавших в беду. Забудь про это.~
@878  = ~Сандра, у тебя есть что-нибудь более конкретное, есть идеи, где её найти и как освободить?~
@879  = ~<CHARNAME>, ты не в себе? Я не могу поверить в то, что только что услышала. Пусть судьба девушки послужит тебе уроком не злить сильных священниц Мистры. Я не стану так мило просить тебя о помощи в следующий раз.~
@880  = ~Да-да, успокойся Сандра. Похоже, мне нечего сказать по этому поводу. Пусть всё будет по-твоему.~
@881  = ~Ладно, говори, чего ты хочешь, но только быстро. И я ничего не обещаю.~
@882  = ~Ну, первое, что нужно сделать, это найти магический свиток для нашего дела. Поскольку я не знаю этого заклинания, нам нужно купить его в храме. В храме Повелителя Утра в Берегосте или в храме Хелма в Нашкеле должен быть свиток "Камень в плоть", который мы можем купить.~
@883  = ~Затем мы должны найти статую. То, что я видела в шаре, было каким-то местом с палатками, торговцами и флагами. Так что это выглядело как рынок в большом городе или, может быть, какой-то фестиваль. Мы должны попытаться найти такое место, а затем держать глаза открытыми, возможно, какой-нибудь сумасшедший неудачник будет использовать бедную статую как аттракцион, чтобы заработать немного денег.~
@884  = ~У меня есть такой свиток, Сандра, я приберегу его для этой цели. Неприятно думать о том, на что кто-то может пойти ради нескольких монет. Ты была права, что попросила меня о помощи. Совсем недавно я слышал о каком-то карнавале. Где это было...~ ~У меня есть такой свиток, Сандра, я приберегу его для этой цели. Неприятно думать о том, на что кто-то может пойти ради нескольких монет. Ты была права, что попросила меня о помощи. Совсем недавно я слышала о каком-то карнавале. Где это было...~
@885  = ~Неприятно думать о том, на что кто-то может пойти ради нескольких монет. Ты была права, что попросила меня о помощи. Совсем недавно я слышал о каком-то карнавале. Где это было...~ ~Неприятно думать о том, на что кто-то может пойти ради нескольких монет. Ты была права, что попросила меня о помощи. Совсем недавно я слышала о каком-то карнавале. Где это было...~
@886  = ~<CHARNAME>, это должно быть здесь, я узнаю окружение, палатки и всё такое!~
@887  = ~Что должно быть здесь? Ты о чём?~
@888  = ~Окаменевшая священница? Ты говорила про рынок или цирк! Но это вполне может быть и карнавал.~
@889  = ~Окаменевшая священница! Я думала, это будет рынок или цирк, но это карнавал.~
@890  = ~Значит, ты думаешь, что она здесь?~
@891  = ~Я уверена, что она здесь, окружение в точности такое, как я видела в шаре. Мы должны поспешить ей на помощь, <CHARNAME>!~
@892  = ~Но у нас ещё нет заклинания, которое ты мне посоветовала купить для этой цели.~
@893  = ~Мы освободим её так быстро, как сможем. Все ищите статуи, которые выглядят почти как люди. Сандра, обещаю, мы её найдем.~
@894  = ~Давай немедленно вернёмся в Нашкель, там в храме есть всё нам необходимое.~
@895  = ~Мы освободим её так быстро, как сможем. Просто прогуляемся по городу, а потом вернёмся сюда. Сандра, обещаю, мы её найдем.~
@896  = ~(Сандра идёт рядом с тобой, осматривая местность на предмет возможных опасностей. Всё кажется спокойно, так что ты можешь воспользоваться моментом, чтобы узнать о ней немного больше.) ~
@897  = ~(Ты решаешь, что лучше поговорить в другой раз.) ~
@898  = ~Хорошо, что ты присоединилась ко мне, Сандра.~
@899  = ~Ты красивая девушка, Сандра.~
@900  = ~Кажется, твой молот застоялся.~
@901  = ~Неважно.~
@902  = ~Дай-ка проверю.~
@903  = ~Я рада, что нашла тебя вовремя. Ну, не совсем вовремя, учитывая смерть Горайона. Но, по крайней мере, не слишком поздно.~
@904  = ~(Смеётся) Ох, <CHARNAME>, ты думаешь, я слышала этого раньше? Давай двигаться вперёд, пока мы не скатились до глупой базарной болтовни. (Сандра ярко улыбается тебе)~
@905  = ~(Сандра идёт рядом с тобой, осматривая местность на предмет возможных опасностей. Всё кажется спокойно, так что ты можешь воспользоваться моментом, чтобы побольше поговорить в этот раз.)~
@906  = ~Сандра, мне интересно... Что привело тебя на место смерти Горайона?~
@907  = ~Я знаю, что Мистра - богиня всей магии, так почему же ты не маг?~
@908  = ~(Смеётся) Ох, <CHARNAME>, ты думаешь, я слышала этого раньше? Давай двигаться вперёд, пока мы не скатились до глупой базарной болтовни. (Сандра ярко улыбается тебе)~
@909  = ~(Сандра идёт рядом с тобой, осматривая местность на предмет возможных опасностей. Подходящее время, чтобы узнать её получше.)~
@910  = ~Откуда ты, Сандра?~
@911  = ~Я хочу, чтобы ты применила свои навыки исцеления для павшего компаньона ещё раз.~
@912  = ~Мистра дарует всё мистическое искусство, а также силы, которые даёт Плетение. Я никогда не хотела стать просто магом, я хочу использовать свои силы для исцеления и улучшения мира, в котором мы живём. Остальное - длинная история, которую мы, вероятно, сможем обсудить во время нашего совместного путешествия, <CHARNAME>.~
@913  = ~Я с нетерпением жду, чтобы узнать о тебе побольше.~
@914  = ~Я уверен, что не смогу избежать узнать о тебе больше, чем нужно.~ ~Я уверена, что не смогу избежать узнать о тебе больше, чем нужно.~
@915  = ~Я родилась и выросла в Вотердипе. Мой отец там хорошо известен, также как и в некоторых других местах...~
@916  = ~Значит, ты девушка из по настоящему большого города. Я должен был догадаться по твоему виду и изысканной одежде.~ ~Значит, ты девушка из по настоящему большого города. Я должна была догадаться по твоему виду и изысканной одежде.~
@917  = ~Вот так сюрприз. Даже при твоей внешности и изысканной одежде, ты стала довольно хорошим воином. Это не обычно для обывательницы из большого города.~
@918  = ~(Смеётся) Так много предубеждений. Я надеюсь, что мы узнаем друг друга достаточно хорошо, чтобы ты никогда больше не принимал меня за богатую обывательницу.~
@919  = ~(На мгновение её лицо становится очень серьёзным) Я надеюсь, что очень скоро ты научишья доверять мне и другим своим спутникам, и нашим способностям. Многое зависит от этого.~
@920  = ~Это не простой вопрос, <CHARNAME>. Можешь назвать это самоуверенностью, назвать это... назвать это *вызовом*. Я наткнулась на информацию, которая не была для меня предназначена, и я начала сопоставлять одно с другим, что я, возможно, не должна была делать. (В сторону - *Кажется, бегать - у нас семейное*.)~
@921  = ~Если это ответ, то он довольно загадочный.~
@922  = ~Я понимаю, что это так. А также я понимаю, что сказать: "Просто подожди и увидишь" - не лучше. Но я должна попросить тебя о терпении ещё раз. Как только ты узнаешь побольше о себе, обо всей этой ситуации, о моём отце... ты меня поймёшь.~
@923  = ~Кажется, твой отец играет в этом довольно важную роль.~
@924  = ~(Сандра идёт рядом с тобой, осматривая местность на предмет возможных опасностей и время от времени поглядывая на тебя.)~
@925  = ~(Тебе нравится идти рядом с твоей прекрасной компаньонкой. Иногда жизнь просто прекрасна, и все слова будут лишними в такой ситуации.) ~
@926  = ~Сандра, если ты жила в Вотердипе, мне интересно, где ты научился так сражаться?~
@927  = ~Тут растёт дикая земляника, какое редкое зрелище!~
@928  = ~Я бы хотел поговорить с тобой о том дневнике, что мы нашли в Улкастере, если ты не возражаешь.~
@929  = ~Сандра, моя советчица, в твоей замечательной книге говорится что-нибудь об этом Торкионе и мече, который он от нас требует?~
@930  = ~Кажется, Тиакс считает, что твоё наследие каким-то образом определяет, какое будущее тебя ждёт.~
@931  = ~У тебя есть какие-то идеи по этой проблеме *Чуденой Руки*, моя учёная консультантка?~
@932  = ~Я готов отправиться в Вотердип сейчас, веди, Сандра.~ ~Я готова отправиться в Вотердип сейчас, веди, Сандра.~
@933  = ~Тебе не хотелось бы вновь посетить свой дом в Вотердипе, Сандра?~
@934  = ~Ты можешь рассказать мне что-нибудь об этом старике Джопи, Сандра?~
@935  = ~Кажется, знаменитый Дриззт До'Урден хорошо тебя знает, Сандра? Я тебе завидую.~
@936  = ~Я хочу поговорить с тобой о твоих отношениях с компаньоном.~
@937  = ~Сандра, что ты думаешь о нашем милом компаньоне Коране?~
@938  = ~Ты и Бригар, похоже, немного расходитесь друг с другом во взглядах.~
@939 = ~Можешь ли ты отыскать нам несколько деревянных кольев, Сандра?~
@940  = ~Мистра наконец сняла свое проклятие с Эдвина.~
@941  = ~Ты была на этом острове со своим отцом, Сандра?~
@942  = ~Теперь у нас появилось несколько новых *друзей*, последователей Повелителя Бурь Талоса.~
@943  = ~Ты не могла бы рассказать мне побольше о Вотердипе?~
@944  = ~You would envy me even more if you learn that he was one of my teachers in combat, <CHARNAME>.~
@945  = ~It really explains a lot about your impressive abilities. I wish I had a teacher like that - or even a real teacher at all.~
@946  = ~Why did I even ask, I should've known already. I wish I even had any real teacher at all.~
@947  = ~As you had none, the result is then even more astonishing. Do you want to hear the story of how Drizzt and me became teacher and student?~
@948  = ~I'd like to learn anything I can about your past, my love.~
@949  = ~That really sounds like an interesting tale, Sandrah.~
@950  = ~A *good* drow is such a bore, thus any story with him can only be boring.~
@951  = ~Sounds like an interesting topic for this eve, I will ask you about the tale later.~
@952  = ~(Smiles) Does he advance you in the same shameless way he does with me?~
@953  = ~I see, obviously he does it to every girl that is not completely undesireable or too fast to escape him in time.~
@954  = ~I find it kind of amusing and entertaining. And knowing his ways, there is surely no chance any of us two will lose her heart in that trap.~
@955  = ~You are willing to play along to his lines then? ~
@956  = ~And which one of us do you think he prefers?~
@957  = ~But we will surely not start a fight over this *ladies man*, cute as he may be.~
@958  = ~(Sandrah smiles knowingly at you.) Listen, as we both are quite entertained by his advances and we both know that there is nothing but a nice little adventure waiting for us, I see no reason why we should not allow ourselves to enjoy that little fun. We have no reason for jealousy and no way to lose our heart and soul. I am always willing to learn a bit more in the art of carnal love and Coran is a competent subject for learning.~
@959  = ~You mean...you propose we can have him both, let's say, a kind of adventure and entertainment. Is that not a bit...hm, weird?~
@960  = ~Are you really proposing that we two share him between us as our kind of *love toy*?~
@961  = ~It may sound funny but, yes, I propose we will both have a bit of fun with him without need to bother too much. He broke so many poor girl's hearts that I have no scruple to use him for my own joy - and I see no reason why you should not allow yourself the same freedom. What is the danger in that, <CHARNAME>? We know what to expect and we only pay him in his own currency.~
@962  = ~Hm, and maybe learn a bit by the way. I must confess, the chances for boyfriends were really limited in Candlekeep. (Laugh). So we have a deal, Sandrah.~
@963  = ~Hey, I take it as a bit of a competition, let's see who has more success in seducing him.~
@964  = ~The whole idea is absolutely disgusting. I'm out.~
@965  = ~(Smiles) Jealous that he advances me in such a shameless way?~
@966  = ~I see, obviously he does it to every girl that is not completely undesirable or too fast to escape him in time.~
@967  = ~I find it kind of amusing and entertaining. And knowing his ways, there is surely no chance I will lose my heart in that trap.~
@968  = ~Are you joking, Sandrah?~
@969  = ~But I will surely not start a fight over you with this *ladies man*, cute as he may be.~
@970  = ~(Sandrah smiles knowingly at you.) Listen, as we both are quite entertained by his advances and we both know that there is nothing but a nice little adventure waiting , I see no reason why we should not allow ourselves to enjoy that little fun. You have no reason for jealousy and I have no way to lose my heart and soul. I am always willing to learn a bit more in the art of carnal love and Coran is a competent subject for learning.~

@974  = ~Hm, and maybe learn a bit by the way. I must confess, the chances to make our own relationship even more interesting are tempting. (Laugh). So we have a deal, Sandrah.~
@975  = ~Hey, I take it as a bit of a competition, let's see who has more success in seducing you.~
@976  = ~We are on the island of Lendore, far off the shore of Calimshan. It is ruled by the family of the Baron, who was mentioned by Pelltar. This town here and a place further to the south, Garotten, are the only settlements, except for one old castle rotting away somewhere on this island.~
@977  = ~Do you know anyone here on the island?~
@978  = ~Are you aware of any specific problems that may trouble the people here?~
@979  = ~A gentle old half-elf named Billy Bob may still live here in his retirement. He is an acquaintance of my father and somehow also involved with the Harpers. If we find him, he may know of the problems in this otherwise boring place.~
@980  = ~A retired half-elf? Wonder what elves retire from, mh.~
@981  = ~If we find an old half-elf named Billy Bob, he may know of the problems in this otherwise boring place. He is an acquaintance of my father and was somehow also involved with the Harpers before his retirement.~
@982  = ~There is a mentioning here telling that the vampiric blade was constructed by vampires as a trap for those that oppose them. Each swing actually inflicts damage upon the wielder, as his life energies are drained  in order to heal his intended victim. Were this not enough, the weapon is cursed so as to prevent it's removal, and  the user is smitten with a wasting of the mind, that he might not even think of trying to rid himself of it. ~
@983  = ~So if we should really find it, then the only use of it is the relief of these threesome creature from its curse. ~
@984  = ~So we better leave our hands off this task then?~
@985  = ~It would not endanger us, now that we know of its curse, as long as none of us really tries to wield the said weapon. So we should be able to help these ghosts and the town of Beregost, provided we find the item.~
@986  = ~But I assume the book does not tell us where the sword is to be found.~
@987  = ~No, it is not up-to-date with the current whereabouts of the sword as it is really missing for a very long time already. But that at least gives us a hint then. It is very ancient lore, so the places to search for on the Sword Coast must be those of the ancient times as well.~
@988  = ~As old as Candlekeep or Baldur's Gate perhaps.~
@989  = ~Those places you mention are not really old, compared to the long ages that were before them. No, this lore is from times further in the dark. Places like Ulcaster or the Firewine Bridge, or even places not longer remembered any more by the people of the Sword Coast today. Some old ruins, places yet to be discovered.~
@990  = ~Maybe we will find such places on our quests. I remember a guy who had been to Candlekeep a while ago, a scientist Charleston Nib who planned the excavation of some ancient settlement on the Sword Coast. Maybe such are places where we should keep our eyes open.~
@991  = ~When I started to accompany my father on his missions from time to time, I soon found that not always his magic and diplomacy where enough to handle all situations. Sometimes a bit of weapon skills would come in handy, I thought.~
@992  = ~Excuse me, I am not meaning to fall in the same prejudice trap again with you, but a girl like you still seems to be the last person I would expect to pick up a war hammer and fight.~
@993  = ~Women's choice of weapons is not that different from men's, if you ask me..~
@994  = ~(Laughs gently) You are absolutely right. I first tried some more *ladylike* weapons like daggers, and then I attempted ranged weapons to be further away from the enemy's direct attacks. Only when my father got a visit from an old friend, I found my real weapon by coincidence.~
@995  = ~Yes? Tell me.~
@996  = ~I was alone in our house at that hour and spent my time to decorate our entry hall for the coming birthday celebration of my father. It was a warm spring day, so I had left the main door to the town open to let the air in. I was just fixing some flower garlands to the wall with small nails and a tiny hammer when this old friend came in, one day too early for the birthday.~
@997  = ~As Drizzt Do'Urden looks like anything but one of the Realm's most famous fighters, I was just taking him for a thief who had sneaked into the house sensing the unlocked front door. And of course I started to attack him with my little hammer.~
@998  = ~THAT Drizzt Do'Urden? A little girl with a hammer attacking HIM, that must have been quite a sight.~
@999  = ~THAT Drizzt Do'Urden? You are quite some storyteller.~
@1000 = ~I see, his name made it even to the enclosure of Candlekeep. So, Drizzt decided not to clarify the situation of him being a visitor to my father, but rather continued to fight with me. We went for a bit when suddenly my father was standing in the door and burst into a big laughter.~
@1001 = ~So after the situation was clarified, Drizzt declared that he was quite impressed by my natural talent as a melee fighter, even showing a couple of real bad bruises he had taken from me. It was then decided that he would give me some real training whenever he was in Waterdeep and could spare the time.~
@1002 = ~Fighting lessons from Drizzt Do'Urden, oh my, no wonder you know what you are doing.~
@1003 = ~Fighting lessons from Drizzt Do'Urden, oh my, no wonder you know what you are doing. Next thing I learn from you that Elminster himself tutored your spell casting, haha. (Sandrah smiles secretly to herself.) ~

@1009 = ~(Ты закрываешь глаза и открываешь рот, чтобы получить от неё ягоду.)~
@1010 = ~(Ты приближаешься к ней и прислоняешь свои губы к её рту с ягодой, а языком мягко стараешься забрать ягоду из её зубов.)~
@1011 = ~Ты опоздал, <CHARNAME>, похоже, сегодня не твой счастливый день. (Смеётся)~ ~Ты опоздала, <CHARNAME>, похоже, сегодня не твой счастливый день. (Смеётся)~
@1012 = ~Эй, так нечестно, я первый их заметил.~ ~Эй, так нечестно, я первая их заметила.~
@1013 = ~(Прежде чем ты успеваешь получить ягоду целиком, она быстро кусает её, и у вас обоих получается по половинке. Немного сока показывается на уголке её рта.)~
@1014 = ~(Ты быстро останавливаешь текущий сок поцелуем в уголок рта Сандры.)~
@1015 = ~Ты ведёшь себя, как ребёнок, Сандра.~
@1016 = ~Да? (Она подозрительно поднимает бровь.)~
@1017 = ~Твои отношения с Киваном зашли слишком далеко, на мой взгляд. Прекрати это.~

@1025 = ~Я могу сказать то же самое о нас с тобой, Сандра.~
@1026 = ~Держи её занятой, и моя голова будет свободнее для важных вещей.~
@1027 = ~Я просто выполняю свою работу целителя, <CHARNAME>, нет необходимости в твоей ревности.~
@1028 = ~Как скажешь... просто делай это более осторожно.~
@1029 = ~Не смешите меня. Пффф. Работа целителя!~
@1030 = ~(Ничего не сказать и решить внимательно следить за развитием событий.)~
@1031 = ~Ты не умеешь врать. Это просто бардак и неуважение. Я не потерплю ничего подобного в моей группе.~
@1032 = ~Ты свободен делать всё, что ты хочешь, я тебе рамок не ставлю. Просто предоставь мне то же самое, <CHARNAME>.~ ~Ты свободна делать всё, что ты хочешь, я тебе рамок не ставлю. Просто предоставь мне то же самое, <CHARNAME>.~
@1033 = ~Если это так, просто будь немного поосторожнее.~
@1034 = ~То, что допустимо для бога, не допустимо для быка.~
@1035 = ~Если это так, то не жалуйся, если найдёшь своё место занятым.~
@1036 = ~Свобода? Это просто бардак и неуважение. Я не потерплю ничего подобного в моей группе.~
@1037 = ~(Она смотрит на тебя, не говоря ни слова. Когда она поворачивается и уходит, то шепчет что-то, чего ты не можешь понять.)~

@1040 = ~(Things have taken an unexpected road between you and Sandrah. You feel that now is a chance to clarify some issue with her.) ~
@1041 = ~Sandrah, I have thought a bit about what is happening between us. It is all so unexpected and a bit confusing -- but I'm willing to take on to this adventure with you. I feel it too... (Take her in your arms and kiss her)~
@1042 = ~Sandrah, I have thought a bit about what is happening between us. It is all so unexpected and confusing. I have the feeling that there are many secrets you do not reveal to me. ~
@1043 = ~(She responds passionately to your kiss) <CHARNAME>, Oh yes, it will be an adventure, but one we may end successful when our hearts are fully with it. ~
@1044 = ~I'm willing to risk it and handle the surprises that may come. You are strong and passionate and much more than just a companion on this journey. Stop talking, give me another of these sweet kisses. (She closes her eyes as she sinks back into your embrace, her lips half opened for you to kiss.)  ~
@1045 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, there are secrets. But if I am not totally wrong, you are one who wants to reveal them. ~
@1046 = ~Mind that some of these riddles and connections can only be solved by us together. Are you willing to take a small risk for a large gain? (Smiles at you invitingly) ~
@1047 = ~Sandrah, if the prize is worth it, I will. And if the price is YOU, I am more than willing to fight for it. (Take her in your arms and kiss her)~
@1048 = ~Oh, you clever tease. You are really the big city girl that breaks hearts by the dozens. And now you are working on mine. Well, I will reveal your secrets one by one (You open the first button of her robe and glance at her magic necklace hanging down between her two well-formed breasts). Watch out, darling, you may end up as the prize won by the fearless <CHARNAME>. (Laugh and take her in your arms to kiss her)~
@1049 = ~I'm willing to do a lot of things with you together, but I'm not ready to give you my heart. I still don't know who you are and not even who I am. ~
@1050 = ~Sandrah, I have thought long about what is happening between us and I have come to the decision that it is not right. You are young and curious for everything including love, but I don't want to be just another of your experiments. ~
@1051 = ~I'm willing to risk it and handle the surprises that may come. You are strong and passionate and much more than just a companion on this journey. Stop talking, give me another of these sweet kisses. (She closes her eyes as she sinks back into your embrace, her lips half opened for you to kiss.) ~
@1052 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, there are. But I if I am not totally wrong, you are one who wants to reveal them. ~
@1053 = ~Is that how I make you feel, an experiment? You see how inexperienced I am in these matters. I was taking the risk of doing it all wrong because doing nothing instead was even worse. I really care for you and that let me rush out straight away. Was I really that bad at it? ~
@1054 = ~I guess you are right, we are both really beginners if it comes to romance, aren't we? You make me feel happy and afraid at the same moment, one minute hot one minute cold...oh damn, Sandrah. I am babbling like a fool instead of doing this.. (Take her in your arms and kiss her)~
@1055 = ~Oh, you clever tease. You are really the big city girl from Waterdeep that breaks hearts by the dozens. And now you are working on mine playing the innocent little cutie. I don't want to be entangled in your mess of secrets and traps, Sandrah. (She turns away quickly, but not quick enough to hide the small tear in the corner of her eyes - just another of her clever tricks?) ~
@1056 = ~(As Sandrah sees you come near, she starts to busily examine the tome of Faerun history she always studies at quiet moments. She makes you feel clearly that is is not the time to talk with you.) ~
@1057 = ~What is it between you and Talos - or Mystra and Talos respectively? ~
@1058 = ~Sandrah, we are quickly running out of acid arrows. Can you provide us with some once again?~
@1059 = ~Can you call the Vault Sentry to make our traveling faster, please.~
@1060 = ~Sandrah, I have hurt your feelings, I admit. But, please see, for me it is all so unexpected and confusing. And I had the feeling that there are many secrets you do not reveal to me. Can we not talk about it again?~
@1061 = ~Maybe another time.~
@1062 = ~(As Sandrah sees you come near, she smiles brightly:) <CHARNAME>, what is on your mind? ~
@1063 = ~Sandrah, I want to ask you about Gorion again. I just recalled a small incident that I almost forgot in all the turmoil of the last days. You know, on that dreadful day I left Candlekeep with my foster father, I saw you talking to him on the library steps. You may not have seen me, as agitated as you stormed away from him. ~
@1064 = ~Sandrah, my little counsellor, does your famous book tell us anything about this Torqion and the sword he requires from us? ~
@1065 = ~This place does not really look like the kind of palace you must be used to, my love. ~
@1066 = ~Can you call the Vault Sentry to make our travelling faster, please.~
@1067 = ~Sandrah, can you imagine that Tiax could be healed from his megalomania?~
@1068 = ~You seem to go along with Shar-Teel quite well, Sandrah.~
@1069 = ~That is a beautiful flower in your hair, Sandrah. Do you wear it for me?~
@1070 = ~Sandrah, your father and yourself have different reasons to be interested in me, at least this is my interpretation of what I heard from both of you.~
@1071 = ~Sandrah, how important is it for you to be a priestess?~
@1072 = ~Let me get this small bottle of extract from acid slime out. Puuh, what a smell.~
@1073 = ~The remaining material is around, here is wood and over there are a lot of feathers where a buzzard has devoured his prey. It will not take long.~
@1074 = ~We need some material for it, <CHARNAME>, which is not available around here. We will find it in the next forest on our way. I will produce us some arrows then.~
@1075 = ~I see, not everything you can do is by magic, it's alchemy and handicraft this time.~
@1076 = ~You asked me for some acid arrows some time ago, <CHARNAME>. Around here is all I would need to produce us some.~
@1077 = ~Thank you, but our quivers are filled at the moment. I will ask you again if we need some.~
@1078 = ~Very good, I almost forgot it, but my counsellor did not. Go ahead, Sandrah.~
@1079 = ~Remember that it was me who told you of this hut. Take a look around, dear. The roof is still whole, the wind is kept outside, there is a bit of wood left for the fireplace. You bought that bottle of wine in the last town and we have those two rabbits we shot outside. Is it not all we need?~
@1080 = ~Almost, at least better than the cave full of old bear dung we had to take last night from the rain.~
@1081 = ~This straw will make a wonderful playground for us, just give me a few minutes. How about you try to light us the fireplace?~
@1082 = ~* Unexpectedly Sandrah has turned into some kind of busy housewife. She starts to arrange the straw from a half-eaten pile and covers it with one of her expensive coats that she has retrieved from her backpack. Your comrades join into the various activities, like rearranging boxes, barrels and planks, and as you turn around from your well-lit fire, you see a table and stools have been improvised. There is a blanket on the table and even a small bottle used as a vase with some sunflowers in it.*~
@1083 = ~My, I have seen people in the city living in worse places than this. Amazing what a bit of creativity can create out of almost nothing.~
@1084 = ~Other circumstances would have made you the perfect house maid.~
@1085 = ~Honestly, I cannot answer that, as I do not know my father's reason for his obvious interest in you. What I can confirm is, however, that we have not even once talked about you when we were at Waterdeep. Until I left, none of us was aware that the other one knew anything about you.~
@1086 = ~I have no reason to disbelieve you, Sandrah, even though the coincidence has puzzled me a bit in the beginning.~
@1087 = ~I know you good enough by now to see you are telling the truth. Nonetheless, the coincidence of you two having an interest in me for different reasons seems far-fetched.~
@1088 = ~You and your meddling father...I know you well enough to know you just tell those things I already found out by myself and you cannot longer deny.~
@1089 = ~If you think of me this way, why did you even bother to ask?~
@1090 = ~Logical thinking, not one of your specialities, should have told you that even without having coordinated between ourselves, you have come to our attention for a similar reason. Which is in the end no wonder. If I thought that you and your fate would be important for the fate of the Realms, then my father would have come to the same conclusions in his enduring watch over Faerun.~
@1091 = ~Important to the Realms. I thought I would be important to your heart and that is why you are here?~
@1092 = ~Important to the Realms. What could be in a little orphan without power or fortune that would be connected to the fate of the Realms? ~
@1093 = ~I agree with you. Probably without having coordinated between ourselves, you have come to our attention for a similar reason. Which is in the end no wonder. If I thought that you and your fate would be important for the fate of the Realms, then my father would have come to the same conclusions in his enduring watch over Faerun.~
@1094 = ~Of course you are my love interest now. Now, that I have met you and got to know you. But remember, that happened only after I came to your side in order to protect you - and Gorion.~
@1095 = ~Well, yes, you knew about me already before we met, from what you said you saw when fiddling with your father's shard. ~
@1096 = ~Since I learned about you and your fate from looking into my father's shard of Mystra, it is no great coincidence that he gained the same knowledge.~
@1097 = ~Sure that would explain how I came to your common attention. It does not explain what this *fate of the Realms* thing is all about.~
@1098 = ~Do you not see it, <CHARNAME>? Think of all those faceless powers and mysterious assassins that are after you. Me and my father are not the only ones that sense something in you. With the rescue of the mines at Nashkel and the knowledge of a much greater conspiracy behind it, you are already taking on an important role for the Sword Coast.~
@1099 = ~True. And Gorion knew it - on that fateful day we fled from home. If only he would have had the time to tell me something about it...~
@1100 = ~Do not forget the one that started it all for you, the murderer of Gorion! He knows who you are and he is the one who was after you in the first place. I have no doubt that a lot of answers will be received once we got to him.~
@1101 = ~Oh, yes, he will have a lot to explain - when the tip of my sword pins him to the floor like he were a butterfly to be conserved. HA!~
@1102 = ~I'm not sure if I give that bastard the time to explain himself. HA!~
@1103 = ~I could very well say the same about you and her, <CHARNAME>.~
@1104 = ~Well, I...~
@1105 = ~Oh, stop it, <CHARNAME>. (Sandrah laughs lightly and silences you with a small kiss.) Did you expect me to make you a scene now because of her. Do you know so little about me?~
@1106 = ~Actually, I no longer know what to expect at all. Not anymore since I saw you having your fun with her. Is that your way of revenge on me?~
@1107 = ~Listen, <CHARNAME>. I am not jealous and I am not pursuing any revenge. We are making new experiences in a field that is new to both of us. I love you and I feel you love me too. But I do not want to cage you and control you. I appeared by your side out of nowhere and I conquered you without much opposition from your side. Maybe I just overwhelmed you before you could say no.~
@1108 = ~Sandrah, I never wanted to object or say no, believe me...~
@1109 = ~Sandrah, I must warn you, I'm <PRO_MANWOMAN> enough to decide for myself.~
@1110 = ~Make your experiences, <CHARNAME>, as I make mine. Find out how it is with Shar-Teel. It will only make your love for me deeper in the end. (Giggles) And you will learn some practical things on the side, to make our nights more interesting...~
@1111 = ~You are not asking me to stop it with her. I cannot believe that?~
@1112 = ~You sound like you are openly encouraging me to go on with Shar-Teel. You are strange sometimes, but there seems to be some intention behind your words.~
@1113 = ~You still think your charm will get me in the end? Wake up before it is too late.~
@1114 = ~(She looks into your eyes with the enigmatic smile you know now so well.) My one true love, I know that it can never last between you and her. But both of you can grow and learn from it. And it will be to your and my benefit as well as for the good of our group. To fight her off from my side is not necessary. And for you, to frustrate you will only mean you will forever have the feeling you will have missed something in your life. And you will blame my clinging to you and preventing it for that miss.~
@1115 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, you are right. I was there - it is not easy to explain, but I will try. Listen. ~
@1116 = ~I wanted to warn him - but of course he already knew about the danger that was approaching. ~
@1117 = ~I wanted to help him - but of course he refused that from a young girl whom he thought to be ambitious but not yet too competent. ~
@1118 = ~Actually, I kind of knew that it would not really make much sense to talk to him. But I simply had to try, I could not just sit at home and do nothing. Not with what I already knew...~
@1119 = ~But what did you know? And how did you know about Gorion and me at all, over there in Waterdeep? ~
@1120 = ~That are already several questions, dear <CHARNAME>, but I will try to answer them one by one. Let us take a rest here with the group, it will take some time. ~
@1121 = ~(The little group has made themselves comfortable as Sandrah continues) As you know already, my father is a mage highly respected throughout Faerun. He is also involved with the Harpers...~
@1122 = ~The Harpers, I have read about them in the library...~
@1123 = ~Shhhh, <CHARNAME>, I will never finish if you always interrupt me. So, where was I...~
@1124 = ~Ah yes, Elm....eh, my father's study and the crystal shard. (Puts her finger gently to your lips as she sees you want to interrupt again). Right, one of the instruments in my father's study, one that he uses in his many activities to observe the realms and certain activities that he and his friends are interested in, is the Crystal Shard. ~
@1125 = ~The Shard is an item he has directly received from Mystra herself. It allows you to see things at far away places like through an enormous telescope. Sometimes the Shard even gives you a short glimpse into the future. ~
@1126 = ~Of course I am strictly forbidden to go even near the shard without him - but then as a priestess of Mystra and having already finished my apprenticeship in some of Mystra's secrets, it is not really possible to keep it all hidden from me. (Laughs) after all I am my father's daughter, and he is known to interfere with quite a lot of things throughout the four corners of Faerun. ~
@1127 = ~So, without going into every little detail, through the Shard I received some yet unclear information about Gorion and the danger that was approaching, and how it may be connected to some research in history that I am doing myself at the moment.~
@1128 = ~(You can no longer keep quiet with the flood of information she unloads on you) But how come you know Gorion and me - and even Imoen before you even met her? ~
@1129 = ~I had been to Candlekeep once before with my father when he met with Gorion, Jaheira and Khalid on some Harper business. It was at that time I also learned about you and Imoen. ~
@1130 = ~Strange, I recall many of Gorion's visitors, but there never was a young girl among them - be sure I would have noticed such a beauty. ~
@1131 = ~No, no, I recall all of Gorion's visitors, but I swear you were not among them. ~
@1132 = ~Imoen and you were not in Candlekeep at that time. You two were on a hiking trip in the Cloudpeaks. But Gorion had those little memory bubbles of you, you know the ones that capture your image and a short animated moment from your life. He had several from you and even one from Imoen. They were very life-like, I already liked you when I saw you in it.~
@1133 = ~Look how time has flown by. I have much to think about from all the things you told me today. I only know this already: It was good to trust you and not to be afraid. It looks like there are explanations for all the mysterious things going on and together we will find them out. (Take her in your arms. You look long into her dark and almost bottomless eyes before you finally kiss her.) ~
@1134 = ~Look how time has flown by. I have much to think about from all the things you told me today. I only know this already: It was good to trust you and not to be afraid. It looks like there are explanations for all the mysterious things going on and together we will find them out. ~
@1135 = ~Look how time has flown by. I have much to think about from all the things you told me today. I'm still not sure it was good to trust you. It looks like there are handy explanations for all the mysterious things going on and you never lack one. We'll see - I have my eyes open. ~
@1136 = ~(You are near Sandrah. There is so much you want to ask her. Her smile invites you to initiate a talk.)~
@1137 = ~Now, here we are for the first time really alone in a room we can call or own.~
@1138 = ~(Smile at Sandrah and kiss her quickly.) ~
@1139 = ~As you approach her, a sharp pain runs through your ankle and you have to sit down on a nearby rock.  ~
@1140 = ~Sandrah, would you mind to tell me a bit more about your mother. I am still totally confused by this dream or vision I had - and then to find her portrait with me. ~
@1141 = ~Ahem, Sandrah...can you imagine that I really have no interest in women at all?~
@1142 = ~Mmh, you would not by any chance know this Mendas of Waterdeep?~
@1143 = ~Sandrah, what is your favourite colour?~
@1144 = ~I observe you started to care for Xan quite a bit. Is it the healer that tries to cure this hopeless case?~
@1145 = ~We started to talk about your mother a while back but we were interupted by this rainstorm. I would like to continue that issue, if you do not object.~
@1146 = ~Sandrah, you seem to be highly respected at the Waterdeep temple.~
@1147 = ~We have a bit of time now, Sandrah. Please tell me a bit of your position and relation to the famous Mystra Temple in Waterdeep.~
@1148 = ~Your former hate for the red wizard Edwin seems to have changed quite a bit, Sandrah?~
@1149 = ~(Sandrah has taken off her shining armour for the break you have announced for the group. She sits in the sun in just a shirt of some shiny clinging material that reveals more than it hides) You stretch out your hand to touch the shirt. ~
@1150 = ~Say, Sandrah, my disciple of Mystra, what is your favourite spell.~
@1151 = ~(Embrace Sandrah and give her a passionate kiss. ) ~
@1152 = ~(Sandrah has taken off all the scarves and diadems she normally wears in her stylish hairdo and lets her auburn locks fly free in the wind. As usual you have to stop, stunned by her beauty.)~
@1153 = ~When we brought the Shard back to your father, I noticed he slipped some small box into your robes. May I ask you what it was? ~
@1154 = ~You mentioned sometime that you used to travel with your father a bit on his adventures, Sandrah. Tell me about it, please. ~
@1155 = ~It feels a bit empty, Sandrah, without Branwen - even with the two of us together in love. Do you feel the same?~
@1156 = ~Sandrah, I observe you talk quite a bit with Gavin. Say, dear, what do you think of him?~
@1157 = ~(You blow a lock of stray hairs from Sandrah's forehead.) How come you look so splendid, regardless how hard the battle or the march was? ~
@1158 = ~(Laughs) Really? That means I can have you all for myself.~
@1159 = ~No, even if it were not that unlikely as both our quarters of town with the bookshops as well as Mystra's temple would be places where such a scholar and seeker of knowledge would have been.~
@1160 = ~And his strange accent?~
@1161 = ~Different classes of our town speak different colloquial slang - his is none of them. But then the City of Splendour holds people from all places and races and their languages.~
@1162 = ~Still....~
@1163 = ~Still?~
@1164 = ~His way of talking seems to come from another time rather than from another place, if you know what I mean.~
@1165 = ~Hm, you think he isn't what he pretends to be?~
@1166 = ~Oh, no, do not be overly suspicious. He just sounded like a man who has learned our language from some ancient tome or such. Or some very old creature who has not been to the Sword Coast for long.~
@1167 = ~(Wink) Maybe from Balduran himself, hihi.~
@1168 = ~(Laugh) He was probably raised in the lair of some ancient dragon.~
@1169 = ~Whatever, he did not look like a Lich to me.~
@1170 = ~Would you accept *rainbow* as an answer?~
@1171 = ~I almost expected that this *easy* question would not be such an easy thing when it comes to you.~
@1172 = ~I can't imagine any colour to suit you better, except maybe *chameleon*. ~
@1173 = ~It only shows that I am a young girl after all, just trying to make up my mind on a lot of things. I am not set in my opinions and I am willing to learn.~
@1174 = ~That is true of course. But most of the time you are very straight forward and appear to be so very sure of your actions and beliefs.~
@1175 = ~You have your answers and excuses for everything. Even when you contradict yourself.~
@1176 = ~Do you see a contradiction in that? Cannot both aspects exist in a person at the same time?~
@1177 = ~Probably that is true for all of us. Maybe I just chose the wrong question. So how about your favourite dish then? ~
@1178 = ~(Laughs) <CHARNAME>, you really have a talent for the *wrong* question. I do not have one. Today I lust for a bowl of Waterdeep fishsoup, but probably just because there is no chance to get one. And you could make me happy with a very fresh piece of deer loin. But I am afraid with our hunting talents that will as well remain an illusion.~
@1179 = ~You see, it has some advantage to remain flexible. Whatever lands on our dining table tonight, might just turn out to become my favourite dish.~
@1180 = ~One thing I can make sure for you. You will love the dessert. Here is a little appetizer. (Kiss her on the lips.)~
@1181 = ~I'm sure you have your limits like all of us.~
@1182 = ~Let me see...This wooden artefact should be usable to make some. Nobody seems to need it any more.~
@1183 = ~To be honest with you, <CHARNAME>, it has not. I still do not fully understand why you continue to have him with us. But, yes, I have changed in so far that I do not question it any more and just endure it like the constant rainstorms that make the Sword Coast so unpleasant at times.~
@1184 = ~I had the feeling that a little bit more than that is emerging between you two.~
@1185 = ~Let me feel your forehead, is it fever that haunts you? Fine, a bit of jealousy does a woman good, it makes her feel wanted and desired by her true lover. But why did you chose Edwin? That is really an insult.~
@1186 = ~Those Thayan red robes have a reputation in the arts of love. An issue that is of not too little interest to you as well.~
@1187 = ~Have you ever heard the term *one-side love*, dear? Here you have a splendid example for that. He may have the feeling I would be the crown of his harem, but that really does not need to bother us in any way. He will survive the disappointment.~
@1188 = ~I really do not have much need for a wicked wizard in my bed at all. The space is already occupied by the most wonderful, tender, and satisfying lover of the Realms. If only this guy could use his mouth more often for useful things instead of utterly foolish babbling.~
@1189 = ~Useful things like this? (Kiss her passionately.) ~
@1190 = ~I should have known it was a mistake to bring up this topic in the first place. ~
@1191 = ~Neither is it for you. So what do you intend? Let us use him to teach us things we may not dream up ourselves? I would rather we find everything out by our own than with him.~
@1192 = ~(Laugh.) I see, there is no way to convince you of his *usefulness*. Poor Edwin. Too bad he never tried on me.~
@1193 = ~(She sees you observing her and returns you a smile.) Do you feel that southern breeze, <CHARNAME>? I can almost smell those foreign lands and hear their exotic birds sing.~
@1194 = ~I am more fascinated by what the present landscape has to offer with respect to beautiful creatures.~
@1195 = ~There is so much to explore in the exotic creature by my side, who shows me a new aspect of her beauty all the time.~
@1196 = ~Then my efforts to look beautiful for the one I care for are not wasted, thank you. So you prefer this more natural look to the other one.~
@1197 = ~Well, yes, if nature endows one so richly, any artificial attempt to improve it is wasted.~
@1198 = ~You have proven that there is no natural beauty that cannot be improved by a skilled artist to an even higher level.~
@1199 = ~One thing I adore in you, is that I do not have to make such decisions. Any new aspect you show me of yourself is wonderful. It is your ever-changing nature that makes you so special.~
@1200 = ~It's wasted effort anyway. Put your helmet on, we're marching again.~
@1201 = ~The good thing is, that I do not have to make such decisions. Is it not wonderful to be able to show the different aspects of one's nature and change from one moment to another?~
@1202 = ~I envy you for your ability to make the best out of any situation. Not that I want to compare you to Imoen, but one thing you two have in common is your cheerfulness, come what may.(embrace and kiss her.)~
@1203 = ~Oh, Women and vanity, isn't there a single one immune against that?~
@1204 = ~Oh, Women and vanity, seems none of us is immune against that.~
@1205 = ~A woman's secret. No, I do not have secrets with you. So honestly I just use my magic skills.~
@1206 = ~Is that not totally unfair to the rest of us humble beings who are not blessed by Mystra? ~
@1207 = ~You really use your magic gifts on such trifle things? Is that not a real disrespect for Mystra?~
@1208 = ~You are the one to benefit most, you enjoy my looks all the time. But let me be a bit selfish now, and improve your looks, as I need to endure them all day long.~
@1209 = ~*She casts some unknown spell and your armour and weapons start to sparkle like newly created.*~
@1210 = ~*She casts some unknown spell and your robe starts to sparkle like newly created and your ruffled locks all of a sudden are all in place and gleaming in their full beauty.*~
@1211 = ~Not at all! As you may recall the adventurer Midnight, the woman Mystra was before becoming a goddess, was not only known for her fighting powers. Bards have composed and sung countless songs about her legendary beauty. ~
@1212 = ~Then you are performing your duty as her priestess perfectly, as I cannot imagine a bard in the Realms who would not sing of your beauty when he sees you.~
@1213 = ~Then your vanity is inherited. ~
@1214 = ~He is a nice man, if that is what you mean, a bit shy which sometimes makes him appear clumsy. And he lacks a bit of the decisiveness I like to see in a man - and in a woman as well.~
@1215 = ~Hey, if you say *nice*, I can almost guess what you have in mind with him. Beware! You are all mine.~
@1216 = ~That is almost the same that I would say about him. How much do you like him, Sandrah?~
@1217 = ~<CHARNAME>, do I hear something like jealousy from you. You will probably not forbid me a little fun with a man. .~
@1218 = ~But honestly, he is nice and all, but not really my choice. And - hm, he seems to be much more interested in you.~
@1219 = ~Is that what you are talking about with him then? You are talking about me?~
@1220 = ~He tries to, yes, but you know him by now, it does not come out so directly from him. But one must be blind not to see how he admires you.~
@1221 = ~And you encourage him? You want me to gain some experience with men as well, Sandrah?~
@1222 = ~That are multiple questions again, <CHARNAME>. No, I neither encourage him nor frustrate him. I leave that decision to you and try not to influence either of you two.~
@1223 = ~Fine. Let us see what happens then. I would not really reject him if he tries to get to know me a bit more, honestly.~
@1224 = ~This kind of indecision is not the Sandrah I know. Please, be open with me, what do you really think about him and me?~
@1225 = ~Gavin is an honest and earnest man, <CHARNAME>, not like those I choose for my little fun. They know what to expect with me and they get it on a mutual basis. Gavin really cares for you. You should not misuse him if you do not feel more for him. I beg you not to just play with him, that would be unfair. If you just want a little flirt or one-night stand, we will find one for you in the next town we enter. ~
@1226 = ~You are right, I guess. Also it would bring a lot of trouble to our common group if I did that just for a little fun. Best we let things just develop, I cannot make up my mind about him at the moment. ~
@1227 = ~You are right, I guess. Just one more thing, sweetheart. Does he have any idea about us two? ~
@1228 = ~He knows that we are very good friends, <CHARNAME>. But I have no idea how he would react if he finds we are even more than that. He appears to be quite tolerant and unbiased, but to imagine us as lovers may be beyond his imagination.~
@1229 = ~Can you imagine how much I have hoped this moment would come to happen between us. And to be able to let it happen here.~
@1230 = ~I have lost all my doubt I once may have had in our relationship. I am so glad you have kept your faith and tried and tried again. You do not give up a case very easy and declare it as hopeless. Neither in our quests and fights, nor when it comes to love. ~
@1231 = ~Yes, it is wonderful. It lets me even forget what is really waiting for me once we leave this lovely enclave, as surely we must again soon. Once this is all over, I dearly wish to return to here with you. ~
@1232 = ~Do we really need so many words between us still. If I see something in your endlessly deep eyes, then it is the desire you feel for me right now, Sandrah. ~
@1233 = ~(Is it the wine or some magic working on you. You look into her endlessly deep eyes, and see the desire she feels for you right now.) ~
@1234 = ~I want us to lose much more than just our doubts tonight, my sweet hero. (She slowly has taken off her armour and the clothes below and changed into a piece of weightless glimmering material, that lets you see every detail of her body but tempts you even more than pure nakedness.)~
@1235 = ~You were right to wait until tonight, Sandrah. This needs the right place and the right time. (You start to caress her breasts beneath their glimmering sheath.) And the right time is now.~
@1236 = ~I am more than willing to lose myself to you, Sandrah (You start to slowly caress her body beneath the glimmering sheath.)~
@1237 = ~That is my wish as well. But it may only come true in a long, long while. Tonight is tonight, and it is a special occasion for us. We may want to take a preview of what awaits us in the future. ~
@1238 = ~(She slowly has taken off her armour and the clothes below and changed into a piece of weightless glimmering material, that lets you see every detail of her body but tempts you even more than pure nakedness.)~
@1239 = ~You were right to wait until tonight, Sandrah. This needs the right place and the right time. (You start to caress her breasts beneath their glimmering sheath.) And the right time is now~
@1240 = ~You are precious, Sandrah, I would never forgive myself for letting this moment pass in the hope of some vague future. As always you are right in this.~
@1241 = ~I do not deny what you see is real, <CHARNAME>. But I am not in a hurry, we have all night to do it more than once. I want each moment of it to be what we wished for so long that it would be. ~
@1242 = ~We will only find out about that by doing it. (You lift her light body up into your arms and carry her over to the bed.)~
@1243 = ~(You let her undress you slowly bit by bit while she kisses, bites and licks every part of your craving body that she reveals in that process. Finally she leads you over to the bed.)~
@1244 = ~I have lost all my doubt I once may have had in our relationship that at first seemed so odd to me. I am so glad you have kept your faith and tried to convince me in your gentle but steadfast manner. You do not give up a case very easy and declare it as hopeless. Neither in our quests and fights, nor when it comes to love. ~
@1245 = ~You have already changed the person I was before completely, Sandrah. Everything can be different when you look at it from another perspective. You have shown that to me in many instances - and also in love. I have come to trust your lead.~
@1246 = ~(She comes over to you and undresses you slowly bit by bit while she kisses, bites and licks every part of your craving body that she reveals in that process. She slips a negligee like her own over you in the end and leads you to one of the large mirrors of the room.)~
@1247 = ~(As you look at yourself in an outfit you never had possessed before, you feel very beautiful and more of a woman than ever before. You love Sandrah for it and you want to show that love to her - now.) ~
@1248 = ~(As you look at yourself in the mirror, you see a new <CHARNAME>, a beautiful and strong woman, ready to be loved, ready to make new experiences - with your loving Sandrah.)~
@1249 = ~I want us to lose much more than just our doubts tonight, my sweet heroine. To lose ourself in order to gain something new.~
@1250 = ~(She tenderly takes both your hands and leads you over to the bed.)~
@1251 = ~You feel Sandrah's smooth skin through the thin material of her cloth all along the length of your body as she blows a warm kiss into your earlobe. You are drowned in a feeling of togetherness you have never known before. ~
@1252 = ~You feel your bodies becoming like one, melting into one another as your hands start to caress her backside and slowly slide into the moist area of her nether lips. ~
@1253 = ~Her kisses are both inviting and demanding. Your own body erupts under the caresses of her fingers and lips that seem to be everywhere at once. You know that a point is reached where none of you can return any more... ~
@1254 = ~First thing, we did not really travel a lot in the way we do it now. With the potential of the Shard it was more like selecting some place in the morning and returning home after the adventure in the evening.~
@1255 = ~But you mentioned also that you camped as well outside, even at something like an oasis. I only have read about such places in books.~
@1256 = ~Yes. When my father went on one of his missions with me, then often we did not transport directly into the place that needed his attention. It would not always be appropriate to materialise in the middle of an enemy crowd or even in a country town market place, scaring the unprepared peasants.~
@1257 = ~So it happened that we mostly landed in a remote area near the scene of interest and then hiked like normal travellers to our destination. At other times my father used to visit people he knew in the area on such occasions when he was near their place.~
@1258 = ~Wow, that must have been really exciting for a little girl. You saw much of the world.~
@1259 = ~What a way to see the world, really, I did it all from my little room at Candlekeep with the help of my books and my imagination.~
@1260 = ~Your own way to do it with books and imagination spares you at least the spiders in your bedroll and the sunburn from the desert sun, haha. Oh, yes it was always great. And it was also what build our father and daughter relationship. I learned a lot and appreciated what my father actually did in Mystra's name.~
@1261 = ~It was not only fun then?~
@1262 = ~That guy always has a hidden agenda!~
@1263 = ~It was sure a more entertaining way to learn than by sitting in a classroom. But it was education nonetheless. My father never tired to lecture on everything that lay at the wayside, be it plants, animals, ancient ruins or places of history, people of the present and of the past. I guess this large tome I carry along contains only a quarter of everything my father really knows about the Realms.~
@1264 = ~But I think what was even more important than all the lore and the facts, was the way my father himself dealt with things and people. His whole attitude towards life has shaped me.~
@1265 = ~ Sandrah, I have the feeling you are giving a bit of that back to me now. I never had this kind of experiences until now. But at your side a get a notion of what it must have been for you travelling with your father. Or even having one.~
@1266 = ~ Sadly enough, you also learned his ways of manipulation and meddling, my dear.~
@1267 = ~Just a thought that comes to my mind when the Friendly Arm and old lore are mentioned. Something about my home town Waterdeep.~
@1268 = ~I very much would like to do so. Although we meet my father out here from time to time, I would dearly like to share with you a bit of where I came from.~
@1269 = ~Besides, our house and garden would give us all the opportunity to relax for a day or so. And last but not least there is the City of Splendour itself with all its attractions.~
@1270 = ~Now that I know you and your resources a bit better, I cannot imagine that you would not have a means to take us there somehow, am I right? ~
@1271 = ~Good ideas, but with the roads cut off by the present situation, Waterdeep is far beyond the regions we can go to at the moment, even if our current tasks would allow for a day of relaxation. ~
@1272 = ~A town full of wealth and a palace filled with magical items! A valid perspective to leave ol' Sword Coast for a while. ~
@1273 = ~I have no magic device or spell handy to take us there, <CHARNAME>, just a bit of old lore from my book. Whether it is true must be seen.~
@1274 = ~Why do you not just tell us about it? We can see what to do or not to do afterwards, if we see any sense in it. ~
@1275 = ~Spit it out already, woman!~
@1276 = ~There is the story of the Old Waterdeep Road that was supposed to run between the City of Splendour and the Friendly Arm Inn. Even in the old times, it was kept secret among the elves and dwarves and other innate that helped in the building and development of Waterdeep. The lore has it, that on this road travelling times between the Sword Coast and Waterdeep would only be a few hours.~
@1277 = ~But we know the vicinity of the Arm quite well. It seems that no such road is there today.~
@1278 = ~If this road has ever existed, it is surely no longer there. We must have found it otherwise during our travels.~
@1279 = ~Why do you hold us up with such boring old crap. There is no such road any more and you know it.~
@1280 = ~The road would not be that obvious to the passers-by eye. Even those who used it in former days had to use a map to follow it. Maybe some of those maps still exist today on the Sword Coast.~
@1281 = ~We surely have no time to start a search on the Sword Coast for a map we do not even know whether it exists or not, just to have a day off in Waterdeep. ~
@1282 = ~That is true, <CHARNAME>. However, our journey takes us to the Friendly Arm every now and then and it would not hurt to ask old Bentley or Gellana about the road. Those two are there ever since the Friendly Arm exists and would surely know something about it.~
@1283 = ~A valid proposal. We will make some inquiry next time we pass at the Inn. ~
@1284 = ~That is true, <CHARNAME>. However, we may just talk to Jopi, and if he really has some knowledge of old lore of the inn, maybe he can give us a hint.~
@1285 = ~A valid proposal. We will make some inquiry then. ~
@1286 = ~He's just as boring as you are. He'd better have something interesting to tell us when I inquire him. ~
@1287 = ~(Instead of casting a healing spell on you, Sandrah kneels in front of you and starts to unlace your boot slowly.)~
@1288 = ~My sweet priestess, why do you not just cast a healing spell on me? ~
@1289 = ~(Lean back against the trunk of a tree. Close your eyes and let her continue. She is your healer and knows what is best for you.) ~
@1290 = ~Priestess, can you not just cast a healing spell on me like any other healer would do? ~
@1291 = ~Lean your back against that tree behind you. Close your eyes and let me continue. I am your healer and know what is best for you. ~
@1292 = ~Sure. (Do as you are told.) ~
@1293 = ~We need to be quick, danger may be always near. Hurry, please, just a quick spell and back to the road. ~
@1294 = ~My mighty warrior, you are surely not hurt so bad as to need a healer. Bite on your lip, swallow the pain, and quickly back to the road. (Sandrah grins maliciously and leaves you to hobble behind the on moving group.) ~
@1295 = ~(You feel her delicate fingers massage your ankle for a while and the pain is gone immediately.) ~
@1296 = ~Oh, good...~
@1297 = ~(Sandrah continues her massaging and caressing on your bare leg long after the pain has gone. Slowly and tenderly her fingers move up, passing your knee and on to your upper leg.) ~
@1298 = ~(You feel her move a bit and next you realise her mouth is merging with your own in an endless kiss, while her hand is still moving further up on your leg...)~
@1299 = ~I can imagine how puzzled you are. I am confused no less, but maybe to tell what little I know about her will help us see something we have not considered yet. ~
@1300 = ~From the copy of Leonardo's famous painting one can imagine her beauty. And then seeing her daughter only confirms that assumption. And she must have been so much younger than your father?~
@1301 = ~From the copy of Leonardo's famous painting she was about your age and she must have been so much younger than your father?~
@1302 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, you are mistaken like most people when it comes to my father. He likes his disguise as an old man, yes, and he is by his years as a human. But Mystra has granted him longevity and health, so he can compete with any young man any time. In any respect. ~
@1303 = ~Interesting, but today we wanted to talk about your mother. Let us leave your father as a topic for another occasion. ~
@1304 = ~Are you trying to change the subject, Sandrah, we wanted to talk about your mother. Let us leave the old man aside for today. ~
@1305 = ~You are right, but it is almost impossible to talk about my mother without mentioning Elminster in the context. But, well..~
@1306 = ~Her name, as your vision has shown you already, was Khalindra. She was the daughter of a merchant from Innarlith at the eastern shore of the Lake of Steam.~
@1307 = ~But that is more than six tendays away from the Sword Coast and all treacherous seas in between.~
@1308 = ~That must be many tendays away from the Sword Coast. I think I have never seen more than the name in the books back at Candlekeep.~
@1309 = ~Yes it is very far away. Only seldom a ship makes the journey between the two places. Had it not been with my father's Shard and his magic means of transportation I would never have seen it in my life. It is beautiful, it is peaceful, full of exotic fruits and rare animals, the ever-blue sea in the warm breeze...~
@1310 = ~Oh stop it. See the dark cloud over there coming from the coastline. If we are lucky it will only rain...ah, the Sword Coast - let us seek some shelter, our talk must wait until later.~
@1311 = ~So, I told you she was a merchant's daughter, Khalindra of Innarlith, who came to the Sword Coast with her father but never left Waterdeep again, after she met Elminster. I can tell you long stories about the courtship and the journeys the two did together, because that is the only memory I have of her - from the lovingly told tales of my father. ~
@1312 = ~They married soon, as otherwise she would have needed to return with her father to Innarlith. One year later she had me. And another year later she was dead. ~
@1313 = ~I am sorry to open up old wounds for you.~
@1314 = ~That's a life in the fast lane, if ever that expression was true.~
@1315 = ~I am not hurt when I talk about her. Mind that the little baby I was back then did not really know her and thus I have no real memory of her. She exists only as the picture drawn by Leonardo and by the wonderful tales my father had to tell about her. ~
@1316 = ~But then, you must know how that feels as well. Was it not the same with your mother?~
@1317 = ~Yes and no. Me, I do not even have tales about her. Gorion has not even told me her name. I am sure he would have if not death and his cursed murderer had interrupted all. ~
@1318 = ~(Sandrah has taken you in her arms and cuddles you in the way the mothers you both have never known might have done.) ~
@1319 = ~You would not think that this is a gift a father presents to his almost grown daughter, would you? ~
@1320 = ~Hardly. Maybe it was rather the gift of a lover then? ~
@1321 = ~Maybe, if this father wants to lose his daughter to the next male being to pass by. ~
@1322 = ~If this is what lovers give to their girls, I am curious what I will receive from you, now that you are my loverboy?~
@1323 = ~You will find out soon enough. Meanwhile take this as the first rate. (Give her a passionate kiss, while you hands start to stroke that wonderful material and what is underneath.) ~
@1324 = ~How about this. (Try to attach a little yellow flower from a nearby bush on the shirt near her bossom, using the opportunity to explore a bit of what is hidden by the shiny wrapping.) ~
@1325 = ~Read my lips: I-am-not-your-loverboy. End.~
@1326 = ~Probably his Shard has told him already it would be you that would come along. And it looks like he has approved to you.~
@1327 = ~Just like his wise daughter did. (Try to attach a little yellow flower from a nearby bush on the shirt near her bossom, using the opportunity to explore a bit of what is hidden by the shiny wrapping.) ~
@1328 = ~He's an old manipulator and it seems you learned that art quite well from him. ~
@1329 = ~It is silk from Rashemen. My father brought it back from one of his missions.~
@1330 = ~Probably not noticing what it would do on such a beautiful girl like his daughter. ~
@1331 = ~I would dearly know how it feels to wear something like that. ~
@1332 = ~You must try it on, I insist. Wait.~
@1333 = ~(Without anyone from the party noticing she takes your hand and leads you to a group of evergreen thick bushes nearby. She is out of the shirt in no time.)~
@1334 = ~(You take the wonderful material from her hand and let it drop to the ground, as your hands start to explore her soft skin that no silk can compare to.) ~
@1335 = ~(Take the shirt and put it on. It feels wonderful.) Uh, you can probably not go back to the others like this. Take mine in return (Give her the woollen shirt you wear beneath your armour.)~
@1336 = ~(She kisses you on the mouth and helps your hands to caress her naked breasts for a while. She laughs and helps you to put on the silk and then dresses in your old woollen one in return.) ~
@1337 = ~What will the others think if they see us returning from the bushes dressed like that.~
@1338 = ~Cultural exchange between the Sword Coast and Waterdeep.~
@1339 = ~Entangle. (Wraps her arms around you, entangling you completely.)~
@1340 = ~And what comes as second? ~
@1341 = ~You take any chance you're given...stop it! ~
@1342 = ~Silence. (Silences you completely with her lips on yours.)~
@1343 = ~It was a little box I made myself sometimes back but left at home. An experiment in my studies of Mystra's arts. ~
@1344 = ~Something magical then. What can it do? ~
@1345 = ~A successful experiment? I hope it is not dangerous?~
@1346 = ~It is a bit like a bag of holding, only it can create some things in a magical way even if you never put them into it. Also it is a kind of remote access to my purse at home.~
@1347 = ~Does that mean it can produce us things like gold and jewels and such?~
@1348 = ~Useful things for the group or just your little girl's items from the past?~
@1349 = ~I think it can help us a bit. And maybe it has some surprises as I sense my father tampered a bit with it. Knowing his abilities and his humour I am not afraid, but maybe not everything I ask from it will be the expected.~
@1350 = ~We can ask it for gold coins or jewels from my purse at Waterdeep. So it will not be an endless supply, just what I actually own, but it will help us with the equipment we need and (laughs) the bar bills from our endless parties..,~
@1351 = ~And you are willing to give your personal riches for the sake of the group?~
@1352 = ~Be glad you find me in such a mellow mood. Otherwise I would be insulted by such a question. Of course what is mine is yours and for the group.~
@1353 = ~Sorry, I did not mean any insult. So can we put the things we gain as a group back into it for storage? ~
@1354 = ~A good reminder, <CHARNAME>. I wanted to do that in my experiment but laid it aside before I could finish that part. Maybe one of these days we may find a day of rest and I can spend some time working that bit out.~
@1355 = ~Only that I could imagine some other things to do with you should such a day really come along. (The kiss she gives you in return shows you that she was thinking in a similar vein.)~
@1356 = ~There is little time these days for any of the things we might want to do.~
@1357 = ~But meanwhile we may find another feature of the parcel very helpful during our travels. The box can retrieve items of some importance that we may have gained in our adventures but have lost one way or another.~
@1358 = ~That sounds in deed very helpful. Your father is very caring to give such a useful item to you.~
@1359 = ~Finally we made it to this little shelter.~
@1360 = ~Just because you think you were born a bastard does not mean you need to behave like one.~
@1361 = ~What do you mean?~
@1362 = ~Another sermon from my favourite priestess?~
@1363 = ~I can accept some open word when needed, I can even take some rudeness now and then, but your constant insults to me are pointless.~
@1364 = ~Ah, I thought you'd never notice.~
@1365 = ~I'm having my fun with Lady Waterdeep, like it or not.~
@1366 = ~I have said what needed to be said. Do with it what you want. Just do not seek for your counsellor's advice when you go on like that.~
@1367 = ~On the outskirts of Waterdeep there is a racetrack where you can go an bet on a winning horse.~
@1368 = ~And I BET you always want to be the winner.~
@1369 = ~We're neither at Waterdeep nor at some rich people's fun fair, just in case you haven't noticed.~
@1370 = ~I know how it feels when you find that you placed your bet on the wrong horse, <CHARNAME>.~
@1371 = ~It is exactly the feeling I have right now with you.~
@1372 = ~You dare to compare me with a race horse...~
@1373 = ~Ah, shut up. Spare your anger for your enemies, spare it for Sarevok.~
@1374 = ~I will no longer be your temper's toy and puppet. I would rather change my horse in midstream than to drown with it.~
@1375 = ~(The enigmatic smile of your companion makes you move up to her and talk to her.)~
@1376 = ~Sandrah, you have taken quite an extraordinary risk to help a little girl you do not even even know. Your calling as a healer appears in a new light to me today.~
@1377 = ~My only heritage from Gorion appears to be the cult dagger of a Bhaalist, Sandrah. Does that make any sense to you? ~
@1378 = ~Sandrah, you must know on the day I found Gorion's dead body he had this letter, that Imoen had already seen before. The warning of what was approaching. ~
@1379 = ~Sandrah, we need to clarify our relationship once and for all.~
@1380 = ~Now, counsellor, do you have any idea what we have to face here? ~
@1381 = ~May I ask you a very intimate question, my love? ~
@1382 = ~Sandrah, you have indicated in recent conversations that the insemination of your mother by the God of Murder was a kind of revenge on Elminster. What did you mean by that? ~
@1383 = ~I can hardly wait until the dusk will fall and we have time for a rest. I long for you, Sandrah.~
@1384 = ~Wait here, a minute, I need to get us something quickly. (You rush into a nearby shop.) ~
@1385 = ~(Sandrah has taken off all the scarfs and diadems she normally wears in her stylish hairdo and lets her auburn locks fly free in the wind. As usual you have to stop, stunned by her beauty.)~
@1386 = ~I am a Bhaalspawn then. Hence my dreams, my powers, the mysterious foe and assassins, Elminster's interest in me - your interest in me.~
@1387 = ~Sandrah, this is a good place for a rest. Friends, let us sit down and listen to Sandrah and a story that hopefully will bring some light into this confusing quest about my heritage. ~
@1388 = ~Sandrah, my love, we must talk about Xan urgently.~
@1389 = ~The healing process for our elf friend was successful, <CHARNAME>. We have really made him  find hope and love.~
@1390 = ~But the price for it is not cheap for you. I am afraid, you pay with a great loss for his happiness.~
@1391 = ~You know already what is happening?~
@1392 = ~First him and now you. I appreciate your care for my feelings, but you both misunderstand me completely. <CHARNAME>, I am completely happy for you both. My beloved friends have finally discovered their true feelings for each other, is that not wonderful?~
@1393 = ~But you love Xan yourself, don' you...?~
@1394 = ~Yes, and I love you, too. So how can I stand in the way between your two hearts? Know that love does not express itself by ownership. I own neither him nor you for myself. To be part of your happiness and Xan's new found hope for life is what I have gained today. (She kisses you and her sparkling eyes show you the true joy she feels for you.)~
@1395 = ~Do you mean my love for Xan does not stand in the way between us, Sandrah?~
@1396 = ~My, how could it? Our love has gained another dimension today. Love does not lessen just because you share it with more people - it is an endless resource in itself. Now run and kiss your love-hungry elf before he faints from neglect and we have to carry him.~
@1397 = ~Sandrah, you are so wonderful, so different from anyone I know. Probably that is why I love you so.~
@1398 = ~Sandrah, you are so wonderful, so different from anyone I know. Friendship like this is just as valuable as love itself.~
@1399 = ~I am listening.~
@1400 = ~*Once and for all* sounds pretty dramatic. It is not your usual choice of words.~
@1401 = ~Mock me as you want, but listen, I mean what I say.~
@1402 = ~Never mind. It can wait.~
@1403 = ~Oh - that was such a great opening line for...nothing.~
@1404 = ~I was expecting such a conversation sooner or later.~
@1405 = ~You make no secret about your feelings for me, Sandrah. I value you and you know that. You also know that I don't feel the same for you, it's just not there. There is nothing you or me can do about it.~
@1406 = ~However much I appreciate what you do for me and our companions, I can't endure your permanent advances anymore. I tried to make that clear but you ignore my decision.~
@1407 = ~So you want me to leave and end it?~
@1408 = ~I think this is the only sensible solution. Otherwise we both will suffer from the situation day after day.~
@1409 = ~I want you to accept the facts. Otherwise we both will suffer from the situation day after day. I don't want you to leave, I just want you to stop your advances. You and me are nothing that can become true.~
@1410 = ~My heart belongs to another. I can't respond to your feelings. I can offer you my friendship but not my love.~
@1411 = ~You have become a competent leader indeed. As your...former...counsellor I support your decision. Too bad it breaks my heart.~
@1412 = ~(She forces a smile.) I am a healer after all, I am not supposed to die from a broken heart, right?~
@1413 = ~You have become a competent leader indeed. As your...counsellor I support your decision. Too bad it breaks my heart.~
@1414 = ~I need some time to think about it. Let us move. I will follow you for the time being until I see clear enough to make my own plans. Let us talk another day.~
@1415 = ~Do you still have preserved it, I would be interested to see it. It may tell us something that you may have not understood then, but may become apparent with the insight we have gained until now.~
@1416 = ~Here it is, let us read it again together. (Hand her the letter and glance over her shoulder at the words you almost know by heart now.) ~
@1417 = ~I do not have it any more, but I have read it so often, I can recite it to you word by word. (Recite Gorion's letter.)~
@1418 = ~This letter is from my father, it is his handwriting and it is signed *E.* As Elminster.~
@1419 = ~It just confirms what we know already. Your father had sensed the approaching danger. You had seen the same in his shard, Sandrah. Anything else? Something I may have overlooked?~
@1420 = ~You say, it was signed *E.* As Elminster. That would make sense.~
@1421 = ~It just confirms what we know already. Your father had sensed the approaching danger. You had seen the same in his shard, Sandrah. Anything else? Something I may have overseen?~
@1422 = ~(She repeats slowly) *We have done what we can for those in thy care, but the time nears when we must step back and let matters take what course they will.  We have, perhaps, been a touch too sheltering to this point.* Those in thy care!~
@1423 = ~The two babies! ~
@1424 = ~Those? Me and...? ~
@1425 = ~OH MY! <CHARNAME>, do you know what that means? If my father had written that letter a few days before you left Candlekeep and he refers to *those in thy care* - more than just one...~
@1426 = ~...he has not known all those years that only one reached Candlekeep. Strange.~
@1427 = ~...but he has visited Gorion at Candlekeep. With you - you told me about that yourself. Ah, but we were not there during that visit. Should he still have not known that only one had reached Candlekeep? ~
@1428 = ~Unless...~
@1429 = ~Both had actually reached Candlekeep. The second one had disappeared later. That would explain the story of Imoen coming to Candlekeep much later than me. ~
@1430 = ~It is impossible that he had not known this. Unless the error is in our thoughts. Both were there. The second one had disappeared later. That would explain the story of Imoen coming to Candlekeep much later than me.~
@1431 = ~...unless both were really there all the time...Impossible. I would know it.~
@1432 = ~Or not. (Mumbles) The Slayer...~
@1433 = ~(Sandrah turns away and slowly walks away muttering to herself in deep thought).~
@1434 = ~(You know you can only leave her to her musing at this moment. She will come to you with her results, you are sure.)~
@1435 = ~(You let her follow her thoughts while you try to bring order into your own wild guesses.)~
@1436 = ~Or not. The second one has been there before our eyes all the time... ~
@1437 = ~Wolves that were once men and men that turn to wolves. The island seems to be inhabited by a type of werewolves different from those we have encountered on the mainland up to now. The ones here seem to by Lycanthropes, which means they may change between a human and a wolf form.~
@1438 = ~Does that mean that humans we encounter outside of this compound may in reality be werewolves?~
@1439 = ~So we cannot trust anyone on this island as he or she may be a wolf in reality, ready to attack any time.~
@1440 = ~The bad thing is that we will not be able to tell until the human changes into the wolf form for the attack. To be careful on any encounter and have our weapons ready is sadly all I can advise.~
@1441 = ~Which has become our second nature by now anyway (Laugh). Anything else, like garlic against vampires or such.~
@1442 = ~Some of the really mighty Lycanthropes can only be defeated with a silver weapon, I have read.~
@1443 = ~Like the werebane dagger for example, that we once had. Can your parcel maybe retrieve it again for us?~
@1444 = ~Like the werebane dagger for example.~
@1445 = ~If we could only find such a thing! ~
@1446 = ~You know the lore of the Time of Troubles well, <CHARNAME>, as it is preserved at Candlekeep where you grew up with it. When talking of the Gods that stole the Tablets of Fate from Ao you have to free yourself of our mortal views of time and space, which did not exist for them outside of their mortal avatar.
It is thus that Bhaal was aware of his coming death and he took his preparation in putting his seed into women of various races and at different times for them to be awakened from beyond his grave and rise again in his name. This part you know well from Alaundo's writings. ~
@1447 = ~But for the moment let us concentrate on those four adventurers sent out by AO.~
@1448 = ~Adon, a cleric of Sune, Cyric, Kelemvor, and Midnight were successful in finding the Tablets and returning them to Ao. Three of that company, excepting only Adon, were raised to godhood in place of the slain gods - Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul and Mystra.
Bane went to the City of Tantras where He was slain in battle with Torm, but Torm had perished as well. Bhaal was slain by Cyric, who wielded the magical sword Godsbane at Boareskyr Bridge. Myrkul was destroyed atop Blackstaff Tower by Midnight, who had the power of Mystra. Mystra herself was dead by Helm's hand, but Midnight chose to keep the mantle and name when she ascended.~
@1449 = ~Yes, you know your lore well <CHARNAME>. But there are some important details to be added. The adventurers went out in pairs to pursue the renegade gods. So Cyric and his betrothed Midnight went to chase Myrkul, Bane and Bhaal together, as they were partners also in love. You must know that those two were also parents already of a son that had come to adulthood shortly before the events.~
@1450 = ~I see, so as Bhaal had foreseen his death he was also aware who would kill him, or at least he knew it would be the pair of Midnight and Cyric. And your father is the most prominent disciple of Mystra on Toril. The target of his revenge.~
@1451 = ~Almost true, <CHARNAME>. Now add to this the fact that the name of Midnight's son is - Elminster.~
@1452 = ~Oh, so Elminster is really the son of a goddess - and Mystra is your grandmother then! ~
@1453 = ~Not exactly, <CHARNAME>, Midnight was a mortal human when she gave birth to Elminster, so he as well is born a mortal. When Midnight was raised to godhood she gave him her special blessings and also his duties in the name of Mystra. And me, I am the spawn of Elminster and Khalindra, who was also a normal human. And by this I am the grandchild rather of Midnight, a human adventurer of good heart and the courage to fight renegade Gods, than the grandchild of a goddess. ~
@1454 = ~Then Bhaal chose the wife of the son of his executioners to make her the vessel of his revenge and spawn. To bring grief and destruction from even beyond the grave. ~
@1455 = ~Mind something else that is important in this context, <CHARNAME>. Our mortal notions of father, mother, brother, sister and family cannot be applied when it comes to descendants of the Gods. Elminster is Midnight's son not Mystra's, as I am Midnight's granddaughter not Mystra's - and such is true for the spawns of Bhaal, they are not brothers and sisters among each other. And they may be instruments of the God of Murder but they are not sons and daughters. ~
@1456 = ~Yes, all of that is true - except for the last one. My interest in you is of a different nature.~
@1457 = ~But you knew who I was all the time, did you not?~
@1458 = ~This is not really true. Yes, you love me now, but you came to me in search of a Bhaalspawn not in search of a lover.~
@1459 = ~This is not really true. Yes, you trust me now, but you came to me in search of a Bhaalspawn not in search of a friend.~
@1460 = ~Truth is that I did not know that it was you who was the Bhaalspawn I came looking for. Let me tell you everything step by step and you will see. I had no picture of this whole connections until now, just little pieces here and there of the puzzle - just like that torn bedsheet we found together piece by piece. And I had no idea how wonderful and loving you were.~
@1461 = ~I have found in our relationship already that you cannot be so easily judged. Please forgive me my words. I know that the explanation is probably more complex than I quickly assumed.~
@1462 = ~Does anything ever turn out the way we perceive it?~
@1463 = ~You are right. This will be a long story to tell. Do you think the time is right just now or should I tell it to you later?~
@1464 = ~This is a good place for a rest. Friends, let us sit down and listen to Sandrah and a story that hopefully will bring some light into this confusing quest.~
@1465 = ~You are right, we should look for a calm location to settle down and listen to that story with all patience. I will ask you again later. ~
@1466 = ~I have been gathering information and studied all various sources about Bhaal, his spawns, the prophesies of Alaundo and related topics since the day I learned how my poor mother had to die. You know that the God of Murder had implanted one of his seeds into her as his last revenge against my father and Mystra. She died giving birth to that child.~
@1467 = ~We have witnessed now the scene of why this child had to leave Waterdeep and my father. Khalindra's spawn and all the others that the dead god had left behind throughout Faerun were hunted by the various parties with their different interests at that time. ~
@1468 = ~The Harpers, including my father, Gorion, and to our surprise also Winthrop, however believed that the Bhaalspawns by themselves were innocent babies that were not evil and murderous from their blood alone. It is this belief that was given on to me by my father. And now with you, <CHARNAME>, by my side it has been proven. The power of that god is sleeping in you and is awakened part by part as you grow and learn to use it. But how you make use of that power, that is your own decision and guarded by your own will. A fact that only few people can understand.~
@1469 = ~The dreams I had, the ones about blood and murder, those voices trying to convince me that there is only one way for me to follow - that was Bhaal pulling me to the evil side? ~
@1470 = ~The dreams I had, the ones about blood and murder are thus explained by Bhaal. But that's not all, isn't it? ~
@1471 = ~Yes, but your dreams also included Gorion and what he had given to you. The means to withstand this pulling, and the vision of a life where you use your powers against that evil. That is the other face of your heritage, the one that your foe are not able to see.~
@1472 = ~They will see it soon enough - but it will be too late for them by then.~
@1473 = ~They truth of that assumption is yet to be seen.~
@1474 = ~So let me continue my tale. For a long time my search for the second child of Khalindra was in studies mostly, and some few talks I had with my father, who always closed up on me when the topic was brought up by me.~
@1475 = ~Then suddely at the end of this winter, things started to get in motion. The majority of the children were spawned by Bhaal at the same time, shortly before his destruction. Those now reached the age of adulthood. If you trust Alaundo - or rather the interpretation that is believed by the most - this would be the time when they would become aware of who they are, and according to the prophesies would begin their rush for power.~
@1476 = ~In that rush they would eventually be confronted with one another. The result would be an enormous war and the resulting bloodshed would be the source for Bhaal's children to gather more and more power. Or at least those that would survive. In the end the remaining spawns would fight over the Throne of Bhaal for the winner to become the new God of Murder. This is the version I heard at Candlekeep every day from the Chanters.~
@1477 = ~This is the interpretation of Alaundo that most people know, yes. It is not what I believe and it is not what my father believes. It is not what Gorion has fought and died for and it is not what Winthrop thinks is true.~
@1478 = ~Your Candlekeep chanters are the best example for what is wrong. They repeat the same thing every day without questions or doubts. It is said and heard so often, that in the end everyone believes it is true.~
@1479 = ~And here we have <CHARNAME>. A Bhaalspawn. Powerful, yes. A leader, yes and we follow <PRO_HIMHER>. Yes, <PRO_HESHE> kills foe at great number, yes -but <PRO_HESHE> is not evil, <PRO_HESHE> is only defending <PRO_HIMHER>self.~
@1480 = ~Read again Alaundo with this example in mind and you will see what was really said. Bhaalspawns will rise, they will be good or bad. In the attempt to rise to power they will inevitably find each other. But in two possible ways - either as rivals for that bloody throne or as the two sides of a medal. The one, according to Alaundo that will have the necessary power and will to stop the victorious Bhaalspawn to ascend to the godhood and throne of the dead god - will be one who possesses equal abilities, ergo another Bhaalspawn.~
@1481 = ~Is this what we are facing now, Sandrah? Our mysterious foe in the dark is a Bhaalspawn and here is the good one to stop him? The weapon the Harpers forged to stop evil.~
@1482 = ~The rush for Bhaal's throne or return has begun. And here we are in the middle of it all? Hard to believe.~
@1483 = ~Alaundo's prophesy about the rush for Bhaal's throne or return are rather vague. I heard them every day. There is no reason to believe that all of that happens right now.~
@1484 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, this episode here is far from what a clash of the Bhaalspawns for power will look like. And you are not a brainless weapon in somebody's power play. You are a fighter and force by your own means.~
@1485 = ~Thank you, Sandrah. I have much to think about now. Your tale is not even halfway told but it is getting late now. Let us continue another time.~
@1486 = ~I have the feeling that you take some random events and mix them with some weird old prophesy to make me believe you. For whatever reason...I will find out what your insinuations are really about, be sure.~
@1487 = ~You want to talk about religion with me <CHARNAME>?~
@1488 = ~Honestly, I am not a religious person at all, but I know most other people are. Since I start to care for you, as well as you do for me, I do not want to hurt your feelings in that area.~
@1489 = ~Even if it not that obvious, as you are never praying and I never hear you shout *For Mystra* when you go into battle, you are a priestess. I do not want to hurt your feelings when it comes to your beliefs.~
@1490 = ~Remember your history lessons in Candlekeep, <CHARNAME>, what did you learn about my goddess?~
@1491 = ~Actually she was just an adventurer who slew the former goddess during the period when the avatars walked on Toril. She took the slain one's name and cloak and was made her successor by the Overgod Ao.~
@1492 = ~She was human in the beginning. Midnight was one of the adventurers who were called by the Overgod Ao to pursue the renegade gods' avatars on Toril during the Time of Troubles. She and her partner Cyric traced Bhaal and Myrkul, and in a fight of several days finally slew them. The adventurers were later granted godhood themselves.~
@1493 = ~She was a love-hungry party girl who earned herself the nickname *Midnight* and obviously the prototype for young priestesses to follow her. ~
@1494 = ~(Laughs) You have a way to tell these fundamental religious stories in an even more profane way than I could. Never mind, you do not hurt anything in me with that. You are completely right. Midnight was an adventurer, providing her magic skills and fighting power to fight evil. A well-known heroine in her time.~
@1495 = ~She and her friends were appointed then by Ao, alongside Helm, to bring the renegade gods to reason and stop their destructive ploy for power. Ao trusted those mortals more than his godly fellows to help the good side to win against the darkness. ~
@1496 = ~So you see in her more a figure to identify with than a heavenly power that rules your life. I mean, you being yourself an adventurer with magic skills and remarkable fighting power.~
@1497 = ~In a simplified way that sums it up, I would say. So you do not have to deal with topics of religion like with raw eggs, as far as I am concerned.~
@1498 = ~Thank you for the confirmation, I was already guessing as much. ~
@1499 = ~I confess I am relieved. A religious fanatic would not be easily acceptable for me. Not that you gave the impression you were one.~
@1500 = ~My <CHARNAME>, I am hungry again for your tenderness. Please give me a small appetizer right now.~
@1501 = ~(Give her a long passionate kiss while both of your hands tenderly grab the two halves of her behind, that are unprotected by her armour.) ~
@1502 = ~(Feed her expectant mouth with a series of short kisses, like a parent bird feeds its hungry young ones.)~
@1503 = ~(Sandrah responds with moving her hips invitingly against your pelvis.)~
@1504 = ~(You feel your flesh responding immediately to the temptation by getting painfully stiff.) Ooh. ~
@1505 = ~(You feel your flesh responding immediately to the temptation by getting lustingly moist.) Aah. ~
@1506 = ~You look as if you found an egg that can stand alone on its tall end in that shop yonder.~
@1507 = ~Mmh. Something much better. Close your eyes darling.~
@1508 = ~A magic egg? Sometimes even for the mighty mage's daughter some very simple things can provide a greater pleasure. ~
@1509 = ~They did not have what I wanted to get for you, sorry Sandrah. Another day perhaps. (You secretly smile when you see her disappointed look. Like the little girl she has been not so long ago with her father forgetting her birthday.)~
@1510 = ~(You slip an exquisite dried and caramelized Thayan fig between her expectant lips.)~
@1511 = ~Hm, good. (Her mouth is on yours with her tongue forcing the other half of the sweet between your lips in return.)~
@1512 = ~Everything I receive from you in love contains something magic for me in itself.~
@1513 = ~Let us stop for a moment and let us all digest these fresh sweet grapes I just bought.~
@1514 = ~I am afraid I cannot let you go like that. You have raised my expectation so high, I need some compensation.~
@1515 = ~Like this? (Kiss her lightly).~
@1516 = ~(Sandrah has taken a handful of the grapes and pushes your head back to look at the sky. She squeezes the juice from the grapes into your mouth, that you have opened when caught by the surprise.)~
@1517 = ~Wow, the finest wine I ever tasted.~
@1518 = ~Hardly adequate. (Her hand around your neck is tender but nevertheless demanding, as she pulls your mouth down to hers for a long kiss.)~
@1519 = ~Thank you for this advice, my teacher. I am glad you never tire to show me how to do things right.~
@1520 = ~Do we not share exactly that, <CHARNAME> ?~
@1521 = ~It is not about you and me this time, it is about Xan.~
@1522 = ~I have no secrets with him that you may not ask me about. It may even be easier to ask me then him. (Smiles conspiratorially.) We both know him too well.~
@1523 = ~Did you experience the revery once with him?~
@1524 = ~No, my dear, that is the privilege of your race and an experience from which I will forever be excluded. ~
@1525 = ~But you had every other sweet experience with him, so you may imagine how wonderful it is to share his revery with him.~
@1526 = ~I am sorry, I did not think of that restriction. I just wanted to tell you how wonderful it is, not to make you feel the loss.~
@1527 = ~No, my dear, that is the privilege of your being partly of his race and an experience from which I will forever be excluded.~
@1528 = ~You did not hurt me in any way, you just confirmed how much of a better choice you are for Xan in the end. I would never have been able to give him this ultimate fulfilment of my love. I am more than well rewarded to see you two have come to that wonderful point in your relationship.~
@1529 = ~Oh, Sandrah, how much I love you!~
@1530 = ~Oh, Sandrah, how much I appreciate to be your friend!~
@1531 = ~(Sandrah's smile welcomes you.) <CHARNAME>?~
@1532 = ~You look hungry, my love, what do you think of a snack?~
@1533 = ~What would our day be if we cannot find a moment to tell each other of our love? (Embrace her and kiss her willingly offered lips.) ~
@1534 = ~As a child from a metropolis's society I wonder how you feel about nobility and ranks and all such. ~
@1535 = ~I know you well enough to guess the thoughts you roll around in your pretty head may be the same that I have been working on all day. Let us see if our conclusions about Imoen are the same.~
@1536 = ~Sandrah, I would like to ask you for a favour regarding my relationship to Ajantis.~
@1537 = ~I am pondering these strange words of the Githyanki, *Among you is one destined to rise to the Weave*. ~
@1538 = ~This name Sarevok, I read him in the papers we found with Davaeorn. I have the feeling he says something to you.~
@1539 = ~Oh, my light on this dreadful day. (Embrace Sandrah and give her a passionate kiss. ) ~
@1540 = ~I never did regret to follow your advice to take Imoen along with us.~
@1541 = ~My back hurts badly and it's myself I have to blame. As the leader of our group I should have called us to rest already hours ago.~
@1542 = ~Well, friends, let's make ourselves comfortable and learn from Sandrah what is so special about a pile of old parchments, that so many people had to die for them already.~
@1543 = ~I loved the song you performed with our wildcat the other day. I did not know about your musical skills before that.~
@1544 = ~So we have come close to the enemy but the picture has not become clearer to me. You seemed to be able to make more out of that Othlor's appearance.~
@1545 = ~Something just attracted my appetite. (She comes up to you and starts to nibble gently at your earlobe.)~
@1546 = ~Eeek, it tickles...(laugh)~
@1547 = ~Something as sweet as honey would suit me well. (She comes very close and her tongue darts out suddenly to lick imaginary honey from your lips.)~
@1548 = ~(You manage to catch the tip of her tongue with your teeth.) I prefer tender young meat...~
@1549 = ~(Dreamily) Raspberries...chocolate pie...vanilla flan...~
@1550 = ~(Look into your backpack). A dried biscuit...a mouldy walnut...hey, here's a find - pickled herring, oh, but it looks like Haiass has nibbled on it already...Now, how about this. (You serve her a big kiss.)~
@1551 = ~You have done the same, <CHARNAME>, have you forgotten already? It was your blood you gave that rescued Leyala. I was only Mystra's instrument in that.~
@1552 = ~I observe that you are a bit shy to be appreciated for your enormous healing abilities. Not even the high priests at the Temple were able to use the power of the Weave like you did.~
@1553 = ~I have my doubts. Not even the high priests at the Temple were able to use the power of the Weave like you did.~
@1554 = ~(Smiles) Do not forget that your eager counsellor nearly killed the both of us in her blind attempt to do good by using powers that are beyond her control. I promise you this, I will not let such behaviour become a habit to me.~
@1555 = ~We have paid the price but your goddess seems to have further plans for you. Rely on her protection.~
@1556 = ~I have agreed with my free will to help you - and I do not regret it. Yet I know what you mean. We cannot do such things every day. However I do not think you acted foolishly or blind. I would call it a calculated risk instead, (laugh) if a risk really can be calculated at all.~
@1557 = ~Hm. I am reluctant to do so. As I have told you before, Mystra is not one to protect or guide her disciples on their everyday struggle.~
@1558 = ~I see, let us not gamble our lives on the protection we might receive from any God. Let us explore and refine our own resources and rely on those.~
@1559 = ~Mystra helps those who attempt to help themselves - those were your own words once. I understand now that we have to make our own decisions and take our own risks and she might be our aid - or not.~
@1560 = ~I do. Even though there was nothing we could have done about it. It was the risk involved in it from the very beginning.~
@1561 = ~You have warned me about the possibility. But even though, I do not regret a single moment of it.~
@1562 = ~Neither do I. We will keep all these sweet moments we had with her in our common memory. Who knows, we may see her again some day on our travels.~
@1563 = ~I love you, Sandrah. Let us raise our glasses to her and to many a victorious battle waiting ahead for us. This is the spirit she would expect from us.~
@1564 = ~You have sworn that Mystra will demand never such a step from you. I would not be able to take that loss, Sandrah. But this eve let us raise our glasses to her and to many a victorious battle waiting ahead for us. This is the spirit she would expect from us.~
@1565 = ~This eve let us raise our glasses to her and to many a victorious battle waiting ahead for us. This is the spirit she would expect from us.~
@1566 = ~I would wear one for you, if the space were not already occupied. This one is from a secret admirer.~
@1567 = ~What. Who is it? ~
@1568 = ~Who is it? ~
@1569 = ~(Smiles) The essence of a secret admirer is that he is secret, <CHARNAME>. Nothing however for you to worry about, I swear it to you.~
@1570 = ~If you say so, I have no reason to doubt it. (Kiss her.) Don't blame me if I rise a bit earlier tomorrow morning, so I can be the one to give you my flower to wear for the new day.~
@1571 = ~Hm, I will keep my eyes open, my love. You should warn your *secret admirer* about my deadly jealousy however. (Laugh and kiss her gently.)~
@1572 = ~Hm, I will keep my eyes open. I need to know what is going on in my party.~
@1573 = ~(She responds to your kiss so passionately that any doubt about whom she loves is dismissed immediately.) ~
@1574 = ~Really? Have you heard of medical confidentiality? ~
@1575 = ~Imagine that scum wanted to celebrate the event with me.~
@1576 = ~And you really could say no to *such* a man. I'm not so sure I would let such a chance go past.~
@1577 = ~I am glad you let the chance go past. There is nothing he may have in all his sophistication and experience that I could not learn - with you.~
@1578 = ~You should have taken the chance and learn something from him - just that the two of us can enjoy it together afterwards.~
@1579 = ~Doppelganger, you let the chance go past? Where is Sandrah?~
@1580 = ~I would rather continue to learn it slowly bit by bit - together with you, like we have enjoyed to experience before.~
@1581 = ~Oh, yes, this promise I can give you gladly. But say - were you in anyway involved in Mystra's change of mind, I can hardly imagine that? ~
@1582 = ~I take your promise verbally, <CHARNAME>, I would rather continue to learn it slowly bit by bit - together with you, like we have enjoyed to experience before.~
@1583 = ~Darling, I am sure we do not need such help from one like Edwin. I would rather continue to learn it slowly bit by bit - together with you, like we have enjoyed to experience before.~
@1584 = ~You're right, why did I not consult you before I rejected him! I could have learned so much - all those bad experiences I never had.~
@1585 = ~Mh. But say - were you in anyway involved in Mystra's change of mind, I can hardly imagine that? ~
@1586 = ~I have no idea why Mystra did that. I had nothing to do with her cursing him nor with her forgiving him again. I can only guess it is because he is with you and Mystra blesses your path - even in the presence of a red wizard.~
@1587 = ~I never doubted your statement on that before. Now I hope you and Edwin will get along a bit better - as comrades I mean.~
@1588 = ~I'm glad to hear once again that you were innocent of his curse, but I still would not have blamed you for being a bit more active towards Mystra to undo the curse.~
@1589 = ~The ways of your goddess, if you don't know them, then how could I? It's just good that this internal quarrel in the group is now over. Try to be a bit more cooperative with Edwin, please, out of love for me.~
@1590 = ~You have at the same time won the respect of a priestess of Mystra and through that increased the sympathy of her goddess for you. This should weight much more than the ever-changing whims of the Lord of Destruction.~
@1591 = ~A bit more stability in my life does never hurt.~
@1592 = ~One mighty foe more or less, haha. (You try to sound self-assured but you are not.)~
@1593 = ~A confrontation with the Storm Lord would have come sooner or later anyway, <CHARNAME>.~
@1594 = ~You are starting to become a prominent figure on the Sword Coast. And you are harbouring Elminster's daughter in your company. It is unavoidable for you to gather the unwanted attention of the evil forces of Faerun one of these days.~
@1595 = ~It's just bad timing then, I guess.~
@1596 = ~We are torn deeper and deeper into this maelstrom of forces that we cannot defend...~
@1597 = ~You are starting to become a prominent figure on the Sword Coast. And you are harbouring Mystra's priestess in your company. It is unavoidable for you to gather the unwanted attention of the evil forces of Faerun one of these days.~
@1598 = ~Darkness and light, <CHARNAME>. Talos has as many opponents as he has powerful followers. To be visible as a possible opponent may as well mean that you will become an interesting ally for some others.~
@1599 = ~Maybe someone is interested in this item from Mecorima we have gained.~
@1600 = ~I would not object if they show their sympathy and support a bit more open. (Sigh).~
@1601 = ~Nice words...I would prefer strong arms at my side.~
@1602 = ~(Mumbles) I am here, in case you forgot...~
@1603 = ~To rise to The Weave, not a very common expression. The Weave that provides the energy and power used by the gods. But *to rise to it*?~
@1604 = ~As a healer you are granted access to the Weave, isn't that so?~
@1605 = ~Whatever it means, it refers to one of the females in our group.~
@1606 = ~Healers are said to gain their power from the god they serve and they use the power of the Weave for their work. But that is surely not meant here. He also said that his folk would *greet her on that day*. So one of us females in the group.~
@1607 = ~I agree, it is not about healing. It sounds like something to happen in the future, something more permanent. One of the women here will *rise*, but to what or where. These Githyanki travel other planes than our material one - they will greet her on one of those. ~
@1608 = ~The Githyanki travel indeed other planes, some say even those of the gods. I heard this strange expression once - from my father - he was telling me about the woman Midnight who became the goddess Mystra. He used this expression, *she was raised to the Weave". ~
@1609 = ~The woman Midnight, your grandmother, whose example and way you try to follow. Who became the goddess you serve when she was raised to the Weave. Coincidence?~
@1610 = ~I hope it is not again about the Bhaal prophesies and the spawn trying to raise to godhood following her father. ~
@1611 = ~One of the women here destined to visit the gods, to travel their plane one day? Or even become a goddess?~
@1612 = ~Hm. I follow Midnight's way as I see she did the right things. And she is Mystra now, part and inhabitant of the Weave. Am I granted the privilege to see her one day? I sure would have a lot to tell her and especially to ask her. About me - about you - about my father - about herself.~
@1613 = ~A possible explanation, but not the only one.~
@1614 = ~Maybe Jen'lig can provide us with some insight here?~
@1615 = ~Would the Githyanki look forward to greet the new goddess of murder? They are a warrior race, brutal, oppressive and selfish. But they are not known to be especially fond of Bhaal. ~
@1616 = ~I am glad to hear that, otherwise it would really mean one of us Bhaalspawns here would be the new god of murder and not the one to stop the rising spawn.~
@1617 = ~Then maybe one of us will rise to the Weave to deliver this message, the message that the *rising god* will not arrive.~
@1618 = ~Maybe Jen'lig can provide us with some insight here.?~
@1619 = ~Beware! We heard already about the one *rising god*. No future goddess of murder is among us, <CHARNAME>! ~
@1620 = ~It looks like I am the incarnation of the arch evil for him.~
@1621 = ~You? Hard to believe!~
@1622 = ~Are you too tall for his liking?~
@1623 = ~I do not want my companions to quarrel with each other. I expect you to apologize to him, if you have hurt him in any way.~
@1624 = ~There is not much I can do from my side. I practice the magic arts, and even worse, I am a priestess of the goddess of magic. Nothing can be more horrible in his eyes.~
@1625 = ~But you use all your abilities for the sake of our party. He profits from your healing skills as well as anyone else. That should make him see your value in a bit of time, don't you think?~
@1626 = ~(Laughs trenchant.) Maybe his horizon is a bit limited, he cannot see as far as taller people can.~
@1627 = ~Please, Sandrah, I can see you are hurt by such narrow mindedness, but please do not make it worse. I cannot change a granite headed dwarf's opinions, so I beg you to just be strong enough to ignore his insults.~
@1628 = ~(Grimly) I will - for you. I just keep my chin up and look beyond him.~
@1629 = ~Huh, <CHARNAME>, do not walk so close to me, please, we might be seen together. My, what would people think! (Laughs heartily.)~
@1630 = ~Right, I confess my question came out a bit silly. I mean I know that obviously you don't care at all about such things. ~
@1631 = ~Think I already understood. ~
@1632 = ~I try to take people for what they are and pay them the respect I think they deserve, not the one they appoint to themselves by fancy or inherited titles.~
@1633 = ~You seem to treat all nobles, dukes and such as your equal and I bet you wouldn't even bow to a king. But isn't part of the respect people pay to you due to your father.~
@1634 = ~Such pride may easily lead to one's downfall.~
@1635 = ~I admit that, but I already told you long ago that my aim is to be recognised for my own deeds and not for being Elminster's daughter. I think I can well distinguish between those who compliment me for my own sake and those who do it due to my father.~
@1636 = ~What is the status of your father in Waterdeep or in the Realms. Is he one of the masked rulers of the city of Splendour or Mystra's arch priest - or both?~
@1637 = ~(Laughs) Elminster is...Elminster, no titles, no land to rule. He is himself and at home where he lays his head. He is the most free man I know.~
@1638 = ~As seems to be his daughter. Yes, and I love and respect you for that.~
@1639 = ~His influence on you cannot be denied. You follow him in that, but I understand you do it by your own choice and not by any other obligation. And you follow the path of your grandmother Midnight.~
@1640 = ~You free yourself of your heritage first, but then you voluntarily follow your father's ways. Complicated, but I guess I understand you.~
@1641 = ~An arrogant fool thinking to be better than any of us. You can't deny that you're his daughter and heiress.~
@1642 = ~Actually it is for me to pay my respect to you. With the heritage that is yours and a majority of people believing that your path is set by this, you overcome it all to be - you. I love you.~
@1643 = ~Actually it is for me to pay my respect to you. With the heritage that is yours and a majority of people believing that your path is set by this, you overcome it all to be - you. ~
@1644 = ~This is about an ancient legend that is common to all the older races on Toril, such as the elves, the orcs and the dwarfs. For many it is more than just a legend but a place that really exists.~
@1645 = ~Sharkta Fai - according to their belief - is a fountain that is said to restore the bodies of those who have fallen in battle before they go hale to the next world after life. It is guarded by a mighty watcher who makes sure that only those who deserve it will be cleaned and restored by the fountain. Any living creature attempting to use it will lose its life to the Guardian without any hope to enter the afterworld.~
@1646 = ~Some necromancers however think, that if a living creature bathes in the fountain, it will not only be restored with enormous power but also will gain endless life.~
@1647 = ~This will explain the pirate's actions. The prospect of eternal life is reason enough for such a man to kill a whole ship crew and more.~
@1648 = ~After his deeds so far we can be sure that he will not stop until he has found the papers and us. Regardless how useless they will be for him. It is my impression that he does not know this little bit yet.~
@1649 = ~Useless? You mean that all his crimes and all our own adventures have been on behalf of a useless stack of parchments? You cannot be true, Sandrah, you must have missed something in your studies...~
@1650 = ~<CHARNAME>, if I say useless, I mean that from the pirate's point of view. The papers themselves tell a lot about the fountain, even that it is located in the Stormhorn Mountains, far up in the North of Faerun. But two important bits of information are missing in the stack.~
@1651 = ~One is the exact location in the large lands up there which are the land of the Clan Orcs, orcs much stronger and wilder than any we encounter down here on the Sword Coast.~
@1652 = ~The second missing part is the way how to enter Sharkta Fai. It has not a door you just open and step in. The papers mention a stone and a ritual to be used for that, but nothing more.~
@1653 = ~And you mean that Monteelah does not know about those missing parts?~
@1654 = ~I am sure he has not yet studied those papers himself, otherwise he would not have hidden them and now would need to hunt them. If he had, he would not need them any more but would rather be out to find those two missing parts. The papers come from different sources and are written in quite a number of different scripts and old languages. I doubt that a pirate has the knowledge to decipher them. He would need a very learned scholar for such a task.~
@1655 = ~Someone like you then, my knowledgeable counsellor. But tell me, who do you think has taken the missing bits from the stack then?~
@1656 = ~A monk like those at Candlekeep. But tell me, who do you think has taken the missing bits from the stack then?~
@1657 = ~You are making the assumption that they were in the stack, <CHARNAME>. Well, that might have been the case or not, I have no evidence. The papers, like I said, are a collection of vast parchments on the subject. Many of them are redundant but none of them contains the complete picture. Whoever collected them together may or may not have found the missing parts.~
@1658 = ~Hm. so let me think. We have different possibilities. The missing parts were never in the stack, but Monteelah does not even know that. Or, they were originally in the stack but are missing now.~
@1659 = ~With again two possibilities. They were already missing before Monteelah got them into his possession. Which would mean, that the original collector knew he would only really need these crucial bits and we just look at the leftovers here.~
@1660 = ~Or they were taken from Monteelah by someone else. This same mysterious someone we have sensed all the time somehow. The one from whom the pirate himself was trying to hide with his faked death in Ulgoth's beard.~
@1661 = ~So this is the end of this story then, friends.~
@1662 = ~So the entrance to the afterlife is by a heroic death but not by these papers, just in case anybody wants that already, haha.~
@1663 = ~So we can just get rid of these papers, or hand them to Monteelah, in case he asks us politely enough for them. There is not the threat of a king of pirates with eternal life.~
@1664 = ~So we can just hand these papers to Monteelah, in case he asks us politely enough for them. We will get rid of him, at least until he finds out about their contents himself and assumes that we have the missing parts. If he ever will.~
@1665 = ~It is good to ask, <CHARNAME>, I was waiting for a chance to tell you already. As you know I had the suspicion for a long time, that our true enemy behind this one-man-behind-another-man intrigue would be a Bhaalspawn lusting for power.~
@1666 = ~Now I am about sure that I was right.~
@1667 = ~And this Bhaalspawn is this Sarevok, you mean?~
@1668 = ~Ever since I learned how my poor mother had to die, I studied all the lore about the Bhaalspawn topic I could get a hand on. And you can imagine that in Elminster's house that means something, especially with my father having a similar interest. So there are some names I came across when travelling with my father or spying a bit in his study or with the Shard.~
@1669 = ~There are some people all over Toril that for some reason or other have shown some special abilities, talents and such that point to a Bhaalspawn. My father was observing some of them if he was unsure about them or the direction they would take.~
@1670 = ~And this Sarevok was one of them?~
@1671 = ~Yes. A young man, about your own age, so born at the Time of Troubles when Bhaal spread his seed over Faerun. He showed enourmous physical and mental powers early on. But then all of a sudden he disappeared without a trace. My suspicion is now, that this Othlor we encountered finally found him.~
@1672 = ~So like you told earlier, this Sarevok and his Bhaal powers are misused by this strange Rashemen wizard - but how does that fit to Gorion's death, his hunting us and finally the whole iron crisis?~
@1673 = ~That is exactly the question, <CHARNAME>. I am afraid the answer is, that it does not fit. And that worries me more than everything else.~
@1674 = ~Why?~
@1675 = ~Because it leads me to believe that Sarevok has rather used the Othlor than vice versa. He has learned all he could from this wizard of significant power, but now he is using what he has learned for his own purpose.~
@1676 = ~But what might that purpose be and how does it explain our role in it?~
@1677 = ~The prophesies of Alaundo, <CHARNAME>! Sarevok attempts to fulfil them, with himself rising to Bhaal's throne. Remember the Othlor's warning about the *rising god*. This crisis and the possible war with Amn, that will be a bloodshed to feed the growing power of the God of Murder.~
@1678 = ~Gorion's death, my dreams about rivers of blood. For whatever reason he seems to know that I would be the one to try and stop him. But I guess he doesn't know that I have you by my side in this.~
@1679 = ~By now you have certainly found one of my methods of investigation. Pretend that you know more than you actually do and bluff the rest out of your subject. It worked well on this guy again.~
@1680 = ~Let me catch up with you. He is the same one who way back then chased Gorion and Winthrop with the babies across the Sword Coast. But it seems he had failed. Due to your father's involvement. Right so far?~
@1681 = ~Perfectly right. Those children were special in their heritage and their abilities. ~
@1682 = ~Bhaalspawns, destined to grow in them the powers of the God of Murder. Your father and his friends protected them - as we know him, he did it to prevent them being mistreated and misused for an evil purpose. A purpose like that one of the Othlor.~
@1683 = ~Again perfectly right. But the Othlor did not get them, so much he confessed to my bluff. They came safely to Candlekeep. But somehow he got possession of another one, Sarevok. Mind that the God of Murder has spread his spawn widely to make sure enough of his blood would survive.~
@1684 = ~So the Othlor in the end succeeded to find Sarevok to raise and train him to his liking. At least initially. Sarevok is behind the events we are currently dealing with.~
@1685 = ~And he is the armoured figure that killed Gorion!~
@1686 = ~And he may well be the armoured figure that killed Gorion?~
@1687 = ~That is very likely the case. As well as the fact that he is not doing what his mentor had expected him to do. The powers of Bhaal have taken on their own shape, the Othlor is no longer his master. Things have gone out of control, but not only for this misguided wizard. This Bhaalspawn has become a threat for the whole Sword Coast by now. And we are in the middle of events - and maybe the only ones who can still stop him.~
@1688 = ~So you knew it - my mission and your mission are in the end the same. You found the spawn your father had protected to lead him against the one who rises to follow his godly father. Only a Bhaalspawn has the power to defeat another Bhaalspawn. You found me!~
@1689 = ~This time you are not fully right, <CHARNAME>. I did not know all of that from the beginning. All I knew was, you were the key to this whole mystery, one of those children. And then I fell in love with you and everything has changed. My reason to be by your side now is - you.~
@1690 = ~And still you are right. You are now the one to stop the one who tries to become the God of Murder.~
@1691 = ~Let me think about all of that in a quiet moment, if we still are granted one in these days. I feel you tell the truth and you always did. And I know that you love me and I will hold on to that for strength.~
@1692 = ~Let me think about all of that in a quiet moment, if we still are granted one in these days. I feel you tell the truth and you always did. And I know that you support me and I will hold on to that for strength.~
@1693 = ~Let me catch up with you. He is the same one that way back then chased the refugees with the babies across the Sword Coast. But it seems he had failed. Due to your father's involvement. Right so far?~
@1694 = ~Perfectly right. Those children were special in their heritage and their abilities.~
@1695 = ~Bhaalspawns, destined to grow in them the powers of the God of Murder. Your father protected them - as we know him, he did it to prevent them being mistreated and misused for an evil purpose. A purpose like that one of the Othlor.~
@1696 = ~Again perfectly right. But the Othlor did not get them, so much he confessed to my bluff. But somehow he got possession of another one, Sarevok. Mind that the God of Murder has spread his spawn widely to make sure enough of his blood would survive.~
@1697 = ~So the Othlor in the end succeeded to find his spawn and to raise and train him to his liking. At least initially. We know now that it is this spawn that is behind the events we are currently dealing with.~
@1698 = ~So you knew it - my mission and your mission are in the end the same. You found the spawn your father had protected to lead him against the one that rises to follow his godly father. Only a Bhaalspawn has the power to defeat another Bhaalspawn. You found me!~
@1699 = ~This time you are not fully right, <CHARNAME>. I did not know all of that from the beginning. All I knew was, you were the key to this whole mystery. And then I fell in love with you and everything has changed. My reason to be by your side now is - you.~
@1700 = ~And still you are right. You are one of the children who were hunted and you are now the one to stop the one who tries to become the God of Murder.~
@1701 = ~You will feel like brand new in a few minutes, if you follow my healer's advice strictly. Lay down on this blanket face down now.~
@1702 = ~(Follow her advice.)~
@1703 = ~In a minute, I first must...(You find yourself face down on the blanket by her feet. You have hardly recognised the slight push and your feet suddenly loosing their grip below you.) ~
@1704 = ~But...~
@1705 = ~No *ifs or buts*. Be leader tomorrow again, now the healer is in command.~
@1706 = ~(Your armour and boots are removed within seconds. You feel her hands move under your shirt at the back, they feel cool from some creamy substance she uses. Slowly her massage begins to remove the strain and aches from your muscles)~
@1707 = ~Oooh, yes. Continue, sweetheart.~
@1708 = ~(You make a playful attempt to escape her. She just applies two fingertips to a specific nerve near your left shoulder and you sink back helplessly to the blanket. Resistance seems to be pointless here.)~
@1709 = ~(The darkness is now complete around you and Sandrah removes your remaining clothes bit by bit, massaging carefully every new part of your body that becomes undressed.)~
@1710 = ~(She has turned you now on your back and starts her work on the front part of your body. Whenever you get a chance, you manage to remove a part of her clothes in return.)~
@1711 = ~(She has turned you now on your back and starts her work on the front part of your body.) Enough. I know well where this will lead to in the end. The medical part is over, thanks. (You tip her light body over and grab your scattered clothes.)~
@1712 = ~(It does not take long for both of you to be completely naked. The massage has slowly turned from the medical to a more erotic treatment of your body.)~
@1713 = ~(You now start to return the caresses to Sandrah as the healer turns into a lover. As Sandrah gets more and more aroused, you feel it necessary to silence her mouth with your own lips and tongue - you do not want to keep your tired comrades awake at this hour...)~
@1714 = ~(She just grins viciously as you turn and walk over to your bedroll.)~
@1715 = ~I will do anything that will make you two happy together, my sweetheart.~
@1716 = ~It is about our marriage plans, Sandrah.~
@1717 = ~You have seen the ring Ajantis gave me. It is an engagement ring - so that means there will be a marriage some time.~
@1718 = ~Yes, Ajantis told me already. Before you ask me anything, please grant me one small wish, <CHARNAME>. Let me help you to choose your wedding dress. (Giggles) I promise it will not be pink.~
@1719 = ~Of course you must do that. I was about to ask you for your advice on that subject anyway. But I wanted to ask you for even more. I want you to be my maid of honour on the celebration.~
@1720 = ~With pleasure. I can be as close as possible to you on that special event. But is there already a date set for the fortunate event?~
@1721 = ~Ajantis has suggested to wait until he is knighted. You know how important this is to him. And I have agreed, I mean, why hurry as long as I have my loving man by my side.~
@1722 = ~I see. Yes - I mean it makes him happy and it will make this special day in your life a real splendid occassion, with knights and their ladies and all of us dressed up for the event. And I guess the hero and heroine of the Sword Coast will have their big day in the Helm's Temple in Amn.~
@1723 = ~Amn? But that will not be possible with the threat of a war we have?~
@1724 = ~That is the headquarters of the order, isn't it? A real large temple. How would we get there and then, would the authorities admit us there?~
@1725 = ~If our mission will succeed, everything will look much different. Not only the war threat will hopefully vanish into thin air, but also Ajantis will become a knight of the order.~
@1726 = ~With the influence of his family and your own reputation as the heroine of the Sword Coast and the foster child of the famous Gorion, it is not just a dream to walk down the aisle of the Temple of Amn as the proud bride you deserve to be, my little princess.~
@1727 = ~Oh, Sandrah you are so wonderful! Your fantastic visions make any waiting for the great day worthwhile. But I am sure it will still take some time until then.~
@1728 = ~(Sigh) That means waiting and waiting for the special day to come. ~
@1729 = ~Does time really matter? You have a husband for life already, marriage or not,  and you can live and savour every single day of it.~
@1730 = ~And I will! With him and with you. (You give Sandrah a quick kiss and then look for your future husband to tell him the news.) ~
@1731 = ~If I joke with her about being *besta friends*, we both know in our hearts that it is the truth. She really is my best friend and yours. It is magnificent to see her grow and develop her personality almost daily.~
@1732 = ~She is in deed strong and full of enthusiasm. I would really miss her if she would not be in our group.~
@1733 = ~One has to be strong to endure her but - yes - she is growing constantly and somehow the nerves you have to invest seem to pay back.~
@1734 = ~I still hope we will find out a bit about her past and heritage, even if she herself does not seem to care about that as much as you care about yours.~
@1735 = ~I thought it was you who said that one must look behind Imoen's easy going facade. It is not that she has sleepless nights about not knowing where she came from but I still think she cares a bit for it.~
@1736 = ~She still tries to find out who she really is. Just as we do. And in order to do this one needs to know about the past as well. With her we have even fewer clues than we have for you.~
@1737 = ~If we could only manage to get back into Candlekeep. Winthrop must know something, maybe he even knows something about my past.~
@1738 = ~And Shar-Teel's beautiful voice was quite a surprise as well, I guess. She really could have been someone completely different if her damned father had not stood in the way.~
@1739 = ~It is an adventure to bring it all to the light piece by piece. It is really worth doing so.~
@1740 = ~From what I have heard, my musical side must be part of my mother's heritage. Elminster has many talents, but singing? Huuh, he may use that as a weapon like those wailing dead bringers I have read about.~
@1741 = ~Imagine that, my love, our own place one day - you sit down to play some tune while Shar-Teel's beautiful voice fills the room. And I - I will silently adore you both, with my own voice similar to your father's.~
@1742 = ~What about your own singing, Sandrah? I just imagine my two lovecats performing a duet for me.~
@1743 = ~*Cat* is the keyword here. it will sound like that, I am afraid. I can play quite some instruments but I better keep my mouth shut. Sorry but the voice is Elminster's ingredient to my musical side.~
@1744 = ~One cannot have all. And I am quite lucky to be able to compensate it with my other girl. (Laugh and kiss her gently.)~
@1745 = ~Ha, slowpoke, we will get some sounds out of you afterwards. So much pleasure is never for free, my *loverboy*.~
@1746 = ~One cannot have all. But some prices are happily paid, pussycat. (Laugh and kiss her gently.)~
@1747 = ~I have discovered in my tome that the Glorious Hand is made from the hand of a dead thief. Another interesting fact is that Restenford used to have a thieves guild. Baron Grellus destroyed it when he became the baron. It was located in the sewers under the west side of town.~
@1748 = ~Hm, that sheds some light on it but does not really explain it for me.~
@1749 = ~There is that hanging tree near the Restenford temple. I guess we should find out if there was a thief executed there recently - maybe his hand is missing...~
@1750 = ~(As you approach her, Sandrah's eyes sparkle and her lips display that undecipherable smile you observed so many times already.)~
@1751 = ~I was wondering about one thing from Gorion's letter about my heritage, Sandrah.~
@1752 = ~(Sandrah has taken off her armour and stretches her wonderous body in the dim light letting you admire her beauty and grace to full extend. Once again you recognise in wonder how young and fragile your companion is - a fact you tend to forget when she acts as your fighter cleric in the daily battles.)~
@1753 = ~I cannot hold it back another moment, Sandrah. I love you.~
@1754 = ~Sandrah, are you familiar with the studies of Narvantial of Soubar?~
@1755 = ~As a child from a metropole's society I wonder how you feel about nobility and ranks and all such.~
@1756 = ~Skie another Bhaalspawn, is that really what you think?~
@1757 = ~We were talking about children the other day, Sandrah, and about my heritage in this context.~
@1758 = ~Do you still think Caelar Argent may be a Bhaalspawn?~
@1759 = ~If Caelar Argent really is in need of my blood to activate the portal for her crusade, it finally proofs she is no Bhaalspawn herself, whatever they say in Baldur's Gate.~
@1760 = ~I am contemplating Madele's words about that Harper's raid and the stolen children.~
@1761 = ~I could see that you had to restrain yourself quite a bit not to strike that Torsin de Lancie down with your hammer.~
@1762 = ~Let me check on the option, just one second.~
@1763 = ~I...do not listen to me, <CHARNAME>, I probably over react when it comes to your *siblings*. A mother dying in child bed and a rich girl with a killing spleen are not really evidence. We have more important things to care about at the moment.~
@1764 = ~I'm glad you see this yourself.~
@1765 = ~Why don't I believe that you really believe that it's negligible. Maybe I know you too well already.~
@1766 = ~Hm, I don't know what to think of it myself.~
@1767 = ~We are supposed to keep an eye on her anyway. I surely will. Be it only to prove myself wrong. Hopefully.~
@1768 = ~And we both agree that this gnome is incurable mad, do we not?~
@1769 = ~Maybe or maybe not. Often truth comes out of the mouth of children or fools. A new perspective for you, Sandrah. Did you never think that your destiny may be to rule or lead yourself?~
@1770 = ~No - but history shows that good and mighty rulers very often had good advisers to support them. Or good and intelligent lovers.~
@1771 = ~Or both. The lucky ones had both of it even in the same person. (You kiss her passionately.)~
@1772 = ~Hopefully I found at least one of them already.~
@1773 = ~Hopefully I found at least one of them already. And reliable friends are worth a fortune, don't forget that.~
@1774 = ~No - but history shows that good and mighty rulers very often had good advisers to support them. Or good and intelligent wives.~
@1775 = ~Hm, I have stirred up something there, it seems.~
@1776 = ~You have given me a lot of hope with your knowledge. It is a precious thought that the terrible heritage ends with my generation of Bhaalspawns - unless one of them would raise to godhood.~
@1777 = ~Which is something that we will prevent!~
@1778 = ~The reason I started this conversation was actually aimed at your own heritage and especially your own relationship to godly blood.~
@1779 = ~Do I need to remind you, that my grandparents, although Gods by now, where of human origin and my father was received while both where still in their human form. My father is blessed by Mystra with special abilities but he and my mother are mortal humans, and so am I.~
@1780 = ~Yes, yes, I know all of that. But other than the blood of a god in my veins that ends with me, your bloodline continues through the generations - and it is a very special one.~
@1781 = ~What are you aiming at?~
@1782 = ~We have the evidence that from the same blood that runs in your veins at least two gods - Mystra and Cyric - have been elevated in the past. I say at least, because according to the scriptures of Narvantial there were even more in the past - and there will be future gods coming from that line you represent.~
@1783 = ~Oh, no, <CHARNAME>, that is just too much! Shall I think of myself as the possible mother or grandmother of future gods just based on some vague and lost studies of an obscure historian? ~
@1784 = ~Forgive me for bringing this topic up. You are right, it's really very vague - and you are surely not the woman to base your decisions on rumours like that.~
@1785 = ~It is vague, I agree. But what if there was a grain of truth in the whole story...?~
@1786 = ~I should have known it, Sandrah, you would draw your own conclusions and make your own fearless decisions nonetheless...~
@1787 = ~Gorion must have had a reason to keep such an artefact, so much is sure. Just the same we can take it as granted that he was no supporter of the God of Murder.~
@1788 = ~Definitely not, he was surely opposing the remainder of the dead gods followers at any occasion.~
@1789 = ~I know little about his involvement with any such cults but from the few words he ever said about the subject I am sure he hated Bhaal like nothing else.~
@1790 = ~I knew him even less than you did but he did not seem to be the man to keep trophies of any defeated foe. That dagger was one to be used in the bloody sacrifices of Bhaal's followers but Gorion's reason to keep it must go deeper than that.~
@1791 = ~If we only could find out who that woman *A* was...~
@1792 = ~She MUST have been a Bhaalist and she must at the same time have been someone whom Gorion had known. Who knows if that really has any relevance to my past, it may be something from his early days altogether.~
@1793 = ~I know really very little about the man who gave his life for mine. But we probably have other things at hand than to dig into my stepfather's unknown past.~
@1794 = ~(Nodding) I guess you are right, let us move on.~
@1795 = ~(The way she quickly lets the topic drop leaves you with suspicion. You know her well enough to see she is not convinced this is the end of this story - and neither are you. But it seems none of you have any further clue at the moment of how to pursue the issue.)~
@1796 = ~(Smiles) My fellow priests of Mystra like me a lot, and those that are at Waterdeep are my teachers since my earliest years, and yes, my friends as well.~
@1797 = ~To me it looks more like the kind of respect one pays to his superior - and since I know you much better now, it is because of yourself, not due to your father or grandmother.~
@1798 = ~The *Guardian of the Cloak*, mh. Knowing the importance of Mystra's cloak I can only assume that this is not a title attached to a minor servant of the temple.~
@1799 = ~Your explanations are as unbelievable as always. Hiding and evasive as always.~
@1800 = ~You are a good observer, <CHARNAME> and you know me quite well by now. My standing at the temple here is really a special one and it is something I am a bit proud of, because I owned it myself and it is not due to the heritage I bear.~
@1801 = ~Will you tell me about it, please? ~
@1802 = ~Another bunch of secrets that comes to the surface, Sandrah? Will I really ever get to really know you?~
@1803 = ~Yes, sure, it is not a secret, just one more aspect of me that we only barely have touched until now. I can tell you about it right now or later when we have more time, as you wish.~
@1804 = ~I am anxious to hear about it right now.~
@1805 = ~(Smile) Sounds like this will be a longer story for a more quiet moment. I will ask you about it later, Sandrah.~
@1806 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, will you ever learn to trust me, dear? It is not a secret, just one more aspect of me that we only barely have touched until now. I can tell you about it right now or later when we have more time, just as you wish.~
@1807 = ~Fine. So I told you already a bit about my struggle to come to accept my fellowship of Mystra. Just because with my heritage it seems to be the obvious way for me to become a priestess of the goddess, it made it hard for me to accept it. As you know by now, I do not like the feeling of just following a path that I have not chosen myself and I do not believe that anyone's fate is decided and sealed from the very beginning.~
@1808 = ~I am feeling the same, Sandrah. So many think we are just puppets on strings pulled somewhere else, by the Gods or some other manipulators. I am glad we have found each other, trusting in our own judgement and our ability to change things.~
@1809 = ~We are strong, too strong to be mere puppets on strings pulled somewhere else, by the Gods or some other manipulators. We shall only trust in our own judgement and our ability to change things to our liking.~
@1810 = ~ Neither my father nor my teachers at the temple ever tried to push me in any direction, for which I am forever thankful. They provided me with all the knowledge and guidance that let me find my own decision in the end. As Mystra is not a goddess of strict rules and crusted ceremonies but actually requires their followers to be open minded and able to decide on the right terms to conduct their duties in her name, I finally came to accept my calling as a healer and a priestess.~
@1811 = ~(Laughs) As was observed already, I do in her name what I would be doing on my own principles more or less anyway.~
@1812 = ~Yes, that is the Sandrah I have learned to respect and to love. But how does that explain your role in the Temple?~
@1813 = ~Yes, that is the Sandrah I have learned to respect. But how does that explain your role in the Temple?~
@1814 = ~So it's your strength and pride that gains you your role in the Temple? Well done.~
@1815 = ~My teachers very early recognised my *rebellious* ways when it comes to authorities and strict observing of rules and such. But they also admired and encouraged my analytic skills and my ability to assimilate magic skills that are a bit off the average path. In council with my father and later also with me, it was decided that my duties for the Temple would not be restricted to the routine service in the ranks but I would be given a special treatment for my own good and for the benefits of Mystra.~
@1816 = ~Does this encompass adventuring through the Realms with me or are you on a kind of leave from your duties right now?~
@1817 = ~Your obligation is now with me and my quest, your Temple has no right to interfere with that, have I made myself clear?~
@1818 = ~In the end, that decision is mine not yours, have I made MYSELF clear?~
@1819 = ~ Actually there is no contradiction between the two. I serve Mystra and the adequate use of her powers in the Realms out there any day. I do my work at your side both as a teacher and counsellor as well as with my healing skills. And I follow the quest of an admirable hero whose fate may turn out to be of great importance for us all.~
@1820 = ~But you always claimed that neither you father nor your temple sent you to my side. How does that fit?~
@1821 = ~It is true that I found the way to you on my own, without any involvement of my father or Mystra's Temple. However it seems to me now, that my place at your side very well coincides with the general missions and duties I perform in the name of my goddess.~
@1822 = ~During my education and also by helping my father on his missions from time to time, it soon became obvious that I would become a priestess to go out into the world and to actively work and fight for Mystra where needed. I studied and  I still study the ways and adventures of Midnight and what she did before she was lifted to the godly status. This is my way, I am sure. So I hold no official title and no position in the ranks of the Temple. And it is that and my interest for the family history that has led me to your side.~
@1823 = ~In the end you are a kind of secret agent of Mystra then. (Laugh) It is funny to see that you tried to escape the obvious, which is the ways of Elminster and Midnight, just to end exactly there again - a kind of junior successor.~
@1824 = ~Yes, in a way that is how it can be described. The main difference for me is still, that it was all my own choice and a mission I now accept wholeheartedly.~
@1825 = ~From the respect they seem to pay you, you are quite successful. Which I would admit any time, should they ask me about my statement. (You take her in your arms for a long and rousing kiss.)~
@1826 = ~Well, good that we have clarified the issue now, let's get moving.~
@1827 = ~If you like what you see, <CHARNAME>, why do you not let me feel it more intensively?~
@1828 = ~You are a bit too sweaty for my taste at the moment, why don't we two go down to that small creek down there and you let me clean up your body a bit.~
@1829 = ~If I were a painter, I would sit down right here to draw you - if I were a poet you would be my inspiration in a moment like this...~
@1830 = ~My lovely pussycat, what would you do if you would meet a hungry tiger out there in the dark, as unarmed as you currently are?~
@1831 = ~(Wordlessly she retrieves a small bottle of potion from her pack and takes your hand gently to lead you to the water.) There are a couple of spots I cannot reach easily by my own, that clearly need some expert attention, darling.~
@1832 = ~You don't need to tell me, Sandrah, I know exactly where they are. Be sure they will all been taken care of in just a minute...~
@1833 = ~...but as you are the greatest loverboy in the Realms, you have your own special abilities to show your girl how much you care for her.~
@1834 = ~(You take her offered hand to lead her away from the camp to a romantic clearing you had seen earlier when you decided on the camp location for tonight. Her remaining clothes are removed within seconds before you show her how much passion a demi-god still possesses after a hard day.)~
@1835 = ~...but as you are the most passionate godchild in the Realms, you have your own special abilities to show your girlfriend how much you care for her.~
@1836 = ~If that tiger's name were by chance <CHARNAME> I would let myself be swallowed whole by its hunger. My lust for fighting and resistance has been saturated for today, I am in a mood to willingly surrender.~
@1837 = ~Come, my willing prey, let your tiger digest its booty over there in the soft moss...~
@1838 = ~I can imagine what it is. The relationship between my mother Khalindra and Gorion.~
@1839 = ~Smart counsellor, I would have really struggled to get the question out if you had not known it already. And do you also know the answer then?~
@1840 = ~Right, you have any insight to share?~
@1841 = ~Yes, my father told me about it after our visit to Gorion at Candlekeep when I observed that they referred to my mother's death as their *common grief*. So here is the story in brief. I will tell you other episodes I heard from my father when we have more time on our long calm evenings together.~
@1842 = ~You know that my mother came to Waterdeep accompanying her father who came on some Harper's business besides his trade. So father and daughter met with Gorion, Winthrop and my father at our house and both, Gorion and Elminster fell for Khalindra immediately, with Winthrop already in love with Ismanelda.~
@1843 = ~They both courted her for a period of time, but they managed to stay friends even while being rivals for her love. According to my father's anecdotes, Gorion was Khalindra's favourite for some time with his charms, but in the end my father's constant and steadfast manners won him her heart. Gorion accepted that decision and stayed their true friend, as you have experienced yourself, however he never took another wife himself.~
@1844 = ~Thank you, Sandrah, for sharing this. I would really like to hear more in a silent moment. Even if Gorion and Khalindra were not my *parents* in the real sense, they are those who come closest to it for a poor demi-god like me.~
@1845 = ~There are many aspects about my Goddess Mystra that are dealt with by Narvantial. The most widely accepted of his theories is the human origin of Mystra since the very beginning.~
@1846 = ~And?~
@1847 = ~Since the very beginning...?~
@1848 = ~You must have an opinion on that issue yourself, I guess.~
@1849 = ~We both know that this is true for the current incarnation of Mystra, as Midnight is my own grandmother and she was a human priestess and adventurer before Ao elevated her to the Weave.~
@1850 = ~What Narvantial claims to have found out is the fact that there has been a succession of incarnations of the Goddess of All Magic and that all of them had been humans before Ao made them wear the godly mantle.~
@1851 = ~Why should Ao do such - I mean if anyone can guess at all why gods act the way they do?~
@1852 = ~Hm. Remember that Ao chose humans during the Time of Troubles to aid him against the renegade gods. With Mystra's role to rule over the Weave while all the gods in one way or another require access to that source of power at the same time, Ao might have followed a similar concept. Instead of giving one of the other celestials that advantage over all the others, he tasked a *mere* human with it, trusting her more than any other god.~
@1853 = ~But why?~
@1854 = ~Go on.~
@1855 = ~Maybe because a human elevated to such power would not so easily join the everlasting competition for more power that seems to continue among the other gods.~
@1856 = ~I found something else of interest in a book about Narvantial's studies. I mean the way he made his choices among the human candidates for the task...~
@1857 = ~(She remains silent and thoughtful for a moment.)~
@1858 = ~I think I know what you mean, <CHARNAME>. His thesis that a specific human bloodline has been chosen by Ao and that all incarnations of Mystra have come from that line - up to my grandmother.~
@1859 = ~And is that true, Sandrah?~
@1860 = ~(Again Sandrah seems to hesitate.) You can imagine that I have investigated quite a bit about that issue, my darling. If it were true, it would mean with both Midnight and my father being the only spawns left from that bloodline...~
@1861 = ~...then you and your children if you would have them one day are the sole heirs of that blood!~
@1862 = ~Provided that Narvantial's theories was true?~
@1863 = ~Are you saying it is not true?~
@1864 = ~(This time Sandrah does not hesitate to answer.) To be honest, I do not know.~
@1865 = ~See, Narvantial's original studies and papers have not been seen since the Time of Troubles. Nothing of the evidence he may have had for his theory is known. All that is left is the fact that in conclusion from his findings he could foresay that my grandmother Midnight would be the next incarnation of Mystra. Why and how he came to that conclusion is unknown, as well as it remains unknown if the same thing had in deed ever happened in previous times. Which of course means that we have no evidence that it will happen again in the future.~
@1866 = ~What about your father or the priests of Mystra's temple? Would they hide such things from you for some reason?~
@1867 = ~(Smiles) I do not think so. All I know about this whole story comes from my father and the priests and I am pretty sure that it is all that any living person on Toril knows about it. Why this Narvantial should really have known more about it or even once held some evidence in his hand remains a mystery.~
@1868 = ~So the whole story - true or not true - has no influence on you in some way?~
@1869 = ~Definitely not. You know me well enough by now. We are responsible for our lives and deeds and it lies in our hands to shape Toril to be the reality we want it to be. I think my grandmother knew that - my father surely knows it - and I believe and act according to that credo too. ~
@1870 = ~I have not gathered much experience as a healer with this type of madness. There is illness of the mind that comes from a loss or a hurt or some other traumatic event. You can slowly find your way into the mind of the suffering person with gaining the person's  trust and listening to his story to find out about the reason for the state.~
@1871 = ~I see that such a procedure is not very feasible during a life on the road like ours.~
@1872 = ~Can a couple of spells not make him more endurable? I'd hate to lose his abilities in the party.~
@1873 = ~It puts me in a bit of a dilemma, I have to confess, <CHARNAME>. Through his strange fixation on my *grandfather* I may gain his trust and he may open up to me so I may learn something about the origin of his state. Probably how he was treated in his childhood. And as a sworn healer it would be my duty to do so.~
@1874 = ~Sounds like now comes a *but*...?~
@1875 = ~This is not a confusion caused by a spell which can be reversed by another spell I could cast. His state comes from deeper inside the mind where you can only venture with the assistance of the patient himself through words and care.~
@1876 = ~I see. Maybe you will find some time during our travel...even if I would lose those moments to spend with you.~
@1877 = ~I see. Maybe you will find some time during our travel.~
@1878 = ~...but I definitely dislike the gnome - like I dislike any follower of Cyric.~
@1879 = ~Because he is your grandfather?~
@1880 = ~Your own goddess slept with Cyric.~
@1881 = ~NO! Have you still not understood. The mad God of Lies is neither my grandfather nor was he the man loved by Midnight. It was Cyric the thief and adventurer who is in my bloodline, not the god he was transformed to.~
@1882 = ~Yes, sorry. You make that an important point all the time.~
@1883 = ~Nitty gritty.~
@1884 = ~(Sandrah has come up to you and silently takes your hand. You walk side by side for a while and you feel the power of her nearness giving you strength and confidence.)~
@1885 = ~You bear the discovery of your heritage quite well.~
@1886 = ~Don't forget I have the power of a God in me, even if I do not give in to his dark luring.~
@1887 = ~The power of a wonderful lover helps me to keep the dark deceiver's persuasions at far distance from my heart. ~
@1888 = ~The support of my friends and companions helps me to keep the dark deceiver's persuasions at far distance from my heart. ~
@1889 = ~You can always count on your healer to help you with that struggle as well.~
@1890 = ~I love you, Sandrah.~
@1891 = ~It's good to have friends like this, Sandrah.~
@1892 = ~Together we can channel the powers of the godly seed inside of you into the direction that Gorion had wanted for you.~
@1893 = ~And I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1894 = ~Even at the risk that our mother may be the same? ~
@1895 = ~You know that I will always love you, <CHARNAME>, however far you like to keep me from you.~
@1896 = ~I need to remind you then, that even if you were the child that she has born, you cannot think of her as your mother - not in the way she was a vessel for Bhaal's seed only. And for the same reason I am not your sister, or even half-sister.~
@1897 = ~But you are rightfully my lover, Sandrah. Still I am sure that I am the child whose birth has caused your mother's death.~
@1898 = ~Still I am sure that I am the child whose birth has caused your mother's death.~
@1899 = ~I admit that you are surely the <PRO_GIRLBOY> that we have seen with Gorion. But there is no evidence whether this was Khalindra's spawn.~
@1900 = ~The dreams I had, Sandrah. Twice I had those referring to your mother and her second child. Why should those be send to me if I were born to another woman? You said yourself once that you think Mystra gave those hints to me.~
@1901 = ~It is soothing to think that. When we look into the sky at night and see this star up there watching us, we look at the same one then. Her death is the source of new love and new hope, thus not in vain. The evil God's plan to revenge on Elminster and his beloved wife has failed.~
@1902 = ~Even more it has failed as it will be this spawn that puts an end to the one who attempts to rise in his name.~
@1903 = ~This whole story will end quite differently from what some mad gods may have conjured up for us. Just wait and see.~
@1904 = ~(It is bedtime already, but Sandrah still sits staring at the flames of the dying fire.)~
@1905 = ~A penny for your thoughts. I will go to warm the bed for us, love, don't be too long.~
@1906 = ~I know you well enough to guess the thoughts you roll around in your pretty head may be the same that I have been working on all day. Let us see if our conclusions are the same.~
@1907 = ~A penny for your thoughts. Don't stay up too long. We need to rise early tomorrow,~
@1908 = ~It is indeed that second Bhaal child that went on the journey with you. Winthrop's girl.~
@1909 = ~And you think we know who it is? ~
@1910 = ~A girl of about your own age. A girl sent off with Winthrop to Candlekeep in the same way you were sent with Gorion. No real evidence that this girl had not reached Candlekeep at the same time that you reached there with Gorion.~
@1911 = ~The torn bed cloth? A pirate's trick then to mislead the hunters. We are sure the Othlor has not got her.~
@1912 = ~A girl nicknamed 'Immi'. A girl with significant courage and growing powers. ~
@1913 = ~A girl who grew up in Candlekeep at my side all those years. A girl named Imoen!~
@1914 = ~A girl nicknamed 'Immi'. A girl with significant courage and growing powers. A girl who turns into the Bhaal avatar before our own eyes.~
@1915 = ~If all other possibilities fail on a case and only one remains in the end, must not that one then be the truth?~
@1916 = ~But she has not those dreams I have. She is not hunted like me. If the same seed is in her, then it has not grown up in the same way as in me, except for that slayer manifestation once.~
@1917 = ~But she has not those dreams I have. She is not hunted like me. If the same seed is in her, then it has not grown up in the same way as in me.~
@1918 = ~Thin evidence. She is not hunted like me. Nobody recognises the curse on her.~
@1919 = ~You are perfectly right, <CHARNAME>. It is this difference I am still thinking about at the moment. I have an idea why that is, but please give me a bit more time. It would be premature to talk about it now already.~
@1920 = ~I trust you in this. I also think we should not talk to Imoen about it before we are not sure about all the aspects. I care too much for my *sister* to hurt her unnecessarily.~
@1921 = ~<CHARNAME>, look there, the demon has lost some items on his hasted departure.~
@1922 = ~Oh, yes, maybe even the shard? ~
@1923 = ~I do not care for demon garbage. We must get out of this hole, if you have no ideas, then just shut up. ~
@1924 = ~If we find the shard, there is a chance I can do something with it. I am not my father, but it recognises my blood and responds to me in a limited way. ~
@1925 = ~Maybe I can get us to the surface with it or at least somehow notify my father through the shard.~
@1926 = ~A straw to cling on, but better than nothing, thank you, Sandrah.~
@1927 = ~A straw to cling on, but better than nothing. Hm, sorry, Sandrah, if I was a little bit gruffy with you, but this demon thing has put my nerves on trial. (Give her a kiss on the cheek.)~
@1928 = ~Let us investigate this hole for anything useful and when ready let me try to activate the shard. ~
@1929 = ~Sounds like a plan now. I will talk to you again when we are ready to go.~
@1930 = ~Shall we try the shard now, <CHARNAME>? ~
@1931 = ~Yes, Sandrah. Let me say we all put our hope in you now.~
@1932 = ~What else, I don't want to hibernate in this hole.~
@1933 = ~Thank you for your trust (Smiles). ~
@1934 = ~As soon as Sandrah touches the shard with both of her hands, it starts to glimmer softly. Obviously it really recognises Elminster's blood in Sandrah.~
@1935 = ~Shard, I am Sandrah, you have identified me. Take me to my father!~
@1936 = ~The Shard did not take us all the way, probably my powers are not yet enough for that distance.~
@1937 = ~At least it got us to the surface again. A little bit of hiking in fresh air may suit us well after this hellish smelling adventure.~
@1938 = ~Hahaha, defeating arch demons with peanuts and performing transportation spells of stone throw length? What kind of priestess are you? (Smile broadly at her.) ~
@1939 = ~Better than nothing. ~
@1940 = ~You have seen my accomplishment with this powerful tool. We have to admit, it still belongs into my father's hand. Let us make haste then to meet him and return the Shard.~
@1941 = ~A strange discovery, <CHARNAME>. The shadow thieves were supposed to be removed from Waterdeep since sometime.~
@1942 = ~Maybe this Khattark plays a role in their return.~
@1943 = ~Maybe they played a hand in the stealing of the shard from your father.~
@1944 = ~The events around Khattark already have shown that security is no longer as strong as should be in this capitale.~
@1945 = ~I heard already rumours about the Commander when I left Waterdeep to come to the Sword Coast. The Open Lord seems to near retirement.~
@1946 = ~We should keep that in mind...maybe they will have a vacancy for a competent <PRO_RACE> in the future.~
@1947 = ~What I can say for sure at this moment is that the Shining Lady really is eloquent. An aasimar she called herself - possible and an explanation for her so-called crusade. It does not exclude her from being Bhaalspawn as well.~
@1948 = ~How that? ~
@1949 = ~Can you explain what aasimar are?~
@1950 = ~Aasimar are descendants of the celestials and thus oppose the fiendish. This may have happened in her case generations ago and does not mean her direct *father* cannot be Bhaal.~
@1951 = ~Anyway, there is a direct interest in you, my dear, an interest in your heritage. And - for our own situation it does not change the fact that the authorities in Baldur's Gate think that she is a Bhaalspawn. The latter may be source for trouble regardless whether it is true or not.~
@1952 = ~When we left Baldur's Gate, I was sure we were doing a right thing - the assault, the panic of the people in the streets...Now that I met her, things get a second perspective.~
@1953 = ~Let us not be too quick in our judgement, <CHARNAME>. We have been used and misused before, fed with lies or half truth to act for one party or other. We will learn more soon and make our own decisions.~
@1954 = ~Just as usual, yes.~
@1955 = ~I can count on my counsellor, so much is assured.~
@1956 = ~I do not fully agree with you, even if I wish it were otherwise. The reason not to use her own blood may be another...~
@1957 = ~I...I think I understand - some drops will not be sufficient for the ritual!~
@1958 = ~You think Gorion may have been one of them?~
@1959 = ~One of those stolen children may have been me, don't you think?~
@1960 = ~One of those stolen children may have been Sarevok, don't you think?~
@1961 = ~One of those stolen children may have been Caelar Argent, don't you think?~
@1962 = ~The Bhaal priestess was mad from all she had to endure but even in madness she did not invent such an event. Fact is the raid happened. Bhaal children were *stolen* or rather rescued by the Harpers. These children survived the attempted sacrifice and early attempt to resurrect the God of Murder.~
@1963 = ~Thank you for staying analytic here. These children, Bhaalspawns, may be alive today.~
@1964 = ~The harper and the priestess fit quite well to what Gorion wrote in his letter.~
@1965 = ~As it were Harpers who rescued them, we cannot exclude that Gorion was one of them. If so, those children we know about might have been among them or maybe this was just one operation of a series of attempts by the Harpers to rescue bhaal children from their early fate.~
@1966 = ~I am sure, we will gain more facts and insights into those dark events and finally will find your origins.~
@1967 = ~It does and we also have the *A* from Gorion's dagger as a further hint.~
@1968 = ~I never liked that man in Waterdeep and this has not improved today.~
@1969 = ~Was he one of your former...~
@1970 = ~So you crossed each other's path in your home town already.~
@1971 = ~NO, he was not one of my...oh, <CHARNAME>, do not insult my good taste.~
@1972 = ~He is a good example for the fact that Waterdeep's commander needs to retire in near future. Promoting men like Lancie...I propose you make up your own mind.~
@1973 = ~Sometimes your emotions get in the way of your counselling, let's drop the topic.~
@1974 = ~I'm not happy with his attitude myself - on the other hand, he has the responsibility for many lives entrusted to him.~
@1975 = ~Yes, he is Waterhavian arrogance condensed in a nut sized brain.~
@1976 = ~<CHARNAME>, ты негодник вырос, как я погляжу. Так вот, какая-то молодая священница искала тебя и твоего приёмного отца. Я не расслышал её имени, Санна что-ли, но она оставила мне это, чтобы отдать тебе. Я всё равно я не могу продать его, потому что не знаю, что он делает. Не могу же я навредить покупателю, продав ему что-то опасное.~ ~<CHARNAME>, ты негодница выросла, как я погляжу. Так вот, какая-то молодая священница искала тебя и твоего приёмного отца. Я не расслышал её имени, Санна что-ли, но она оставила мне это, чтобы отдать тебе. Я всё равно я не могу продать его, потому что не знаю, что он делает. Не могу же я навредить покупателю, продав ему что-то опасное.~
@1977 = ~(Во время разговора Сандра отступает в тень большого придорожного указателя и даже прячет лицо под капюшоном.)~
@1978 = ~Почему ты прячешься в тени? Разве ты не покажешь своё лицо безобидному старику? Может быть, где-то твой обеспокоенный отец ищет свою дочь, которая ушла без предупреждения?~
@1979 = ~Или, возможно, не так уж обеспокоенный отец доверяет своей дочери и знает, что у неё есть веские причины делать то, что она делает.~
@1980 = ~Я вижу, ты довольно умна, маленькая леди в тени, хо-хо. Не плохо для тебя. Значит, умная дочь не так уж обеспокоенного отца, я так понимаю, ты позаботишься о том, чтобы эта странная компания не заходила слишком далеко, не так ли?~
@1981 = ~Да, п... Мистер Маг, я принимаю это на свою ответственность - и, к тому же, надеюсь удовлетворить своё любопытство по поводу некоторых конкретных вещей.~
@1982 = ~(Старый маг вновь обращается к Сандре.)~
@1983 = ~Итак, моя молчаливая малышка, судя по всему, ты хорошо заботишься о своих друзьях.~
@1984 = ~Сандра подходит к магу и обеими руками обнимает его за шею.) Не так сильно обеспокоенный отец не был разочарован, полностью доверяя своей дочери. (Целует его в щёку)~
@1985 = ~Что ж, это может согреть сердце старика...~
@1986 = ~Ох, па......~
@1987 = ~Тссс, Сандра...~
@1988 = ~(Дружески смеётся) Теперь ты можешь отказаться от загадок в присутствии моих друзей. Отец, если они сами ещё не догадались, пора им сказать.~
@1989 = ~(Дружески смеётся) Теперь ты можешь отказаться от загадок в присутствии моих друзей. Отец, они уже знают, кто я.~
@1990 = ~Что ж, дорогая, тогда я снова буду доверчивым отцом. Если ты так говоришь, ты знаешь их лучше, чем я могу узнать издалека.~
@1991 = ~Итак, отец, поскольку ты сейчас здесь как мой свидетель, пожалуйста, скажи им, что я с ними не в качестве твоей тайной шпионки или что-то в этом роде.~
@1992 = ~(Старик обнимает Сандру и целует дочь в ответ.) Дети... хо-хо...~
@1993 = ~Их не так много, чтобы так вздыхать. (Поворачивается к тебе) Ты должен знать, что я его единственный ребёнок.~ ~Их не так много, чтобы так вздыхать. (Поворачивается к тебе) Ты должна знать, что я его единственный ребёнок.~
@1994 = ~И самый дорогой моему сердцу. (Улыбается из-под бороды) Но теперь нам пора попрощаться, миры зовут. Меня в одну сторону, тебя в другую. Пока мы не встретимся снова. (Снова обнимает Сандру. Была ли у него на щеке слеза?)~
@1995 = ~(Сандра покинула свое место рядом с тобой и молча перешла в объятия старика. Она нежно ласкает его бороду, его улыбка становится шире. Тебе кажется, что она снова стала маленькой девочкой.)~
@1996 = ~Но сейчас давай поговорим, как отец с дочерью, дорогая моему сердцу.~
@1997 = ~Да, отец?~
@1998 = ~Thine way with <CHARNAME> has not been unnoticed by one who's path you follow.~
@1999 = ~Have you come to talk to me on Mystra's behalf, father?~
@2000 = ~Daughter, if Mystra wants thine attention she will find it without her servant in between. No, it is the woman who so much guides thine path and whose ways thou follow led by thine blood.~
@2001 = ~It is the woman Midnight then, you are talking about father, your own mother, who is my guidance by the actions that have been passed down in the lore and legends dear to my heart.~
@2002 = ~'tis in deed Midnight who had tasked me long ago with what I do today. Thou hath found thine way to righteousness and great deeds which would be to her liking. It resembles the path thine own grandmother hath chosen for herself at her time.~
@2003 = ~These words are soothing to my heart, father. The ways of Midnight are indeed a guideline I attempt to follow.~
@2004 = ~Thine grandmother hath hoped for such before Ao raised her to her current status. She hath tasked me to give thee the items of her adventuring days when thou would be ripe to receive them by your deeds. This day is one on which thou shallst gain one of them.~
@2005 = ~I will prove myself worthy of this gift, father, even if it is not gods that I have to fight and godhood I will achieve.~
@2006 = ~(Elminster strokes his beard in thought.) The end of this story, Sandrah, hath still to be written.~
@2007 = ~Haiass, come to me. All is fine. The one we normally love is a brute today and deserves to be alone for a while.~
@2008 = ~(Haiass gladly jumps to Sandrah and wags his tail. He gives you a suspicious glance from the distance.)~
@2009 = ~Understand, Haiass, this is a lot of stress. In a while all will be good, just stay by my side meanwhile, good wolf.~
@2010 = ~(She looks at you and shakes her head.) If you are ready to apologize, you know where to find us. (Sandrah and Haiass move to the edge of your party and pretend to ignore you.)~
@2011 = ~Ты имеешь в виду, что у тебя есть свиток, с помощью которого можно освободить эту окаменевшую женщину из её каменной тюрьмы, придурок?~
@2012 = ~*УДАР*~
@2013 = ~Ой! Ты... ты меня ударила!~
@2014 = ~ТЫ ещё жив, чтобы это заметить. Мы избавим тебя от этого свитка, большое спасибо. А теперь убирайся отсюда и побыстрее, пока кто-то из нас не ударил тебя снова. У нас мало терпения к негодяям, наживающимся на чужих несчастьях.~
@2015 = ~Хорошо... хотя такое милосердие... редко с моей стороны, окаменение - ужасная участь.~
@2016 = ~Ну... ладно. Я и сам хотел выяснить, сработает ли этот свиток...~
@2017 = ~(Джахейра какое-то мгновение изучает черты Сандры.) ~
@2018 = ~Значит, если я не ошибаюсь, кое-кто уже послал тебе компанию...~
@2019 = ~... Ты ошибаешься, Джахейра, меня не посылал тот, о ком ты думаешь, честно говоря, он просто случайно узнал. <CHARNAME> нуждается в помощи, и я решила помочь ему по своей воле.~ ~... Ты ошибаешься, Джахейра, меня не посылал тот, о ком ты думаешь, честно говоря, он просто случайно узнал. <CHARNAME> нуждается в помощи, и я решила помочь ей по своей воле.~
@2020 = ~Значит, мои глаза меня не обманули, Сандра, хотя ты сильно изменилась по сравнению с той маленькой девочкой, которую я видела с твоим отцом.~
@2021 = ~Она стала п-п-премилой леди, так п-похожа на свою мать...~
@2022 = ~Пожалуйста, Джахейра, Халид, давайте на минуту забудем о прошлом, сейчас настоящее срочно требует нашего внимания.~
@2023 = ~Хорошо сказано, действительно по-Эл...~
@2024 = ~Прости, Халид, я тебя перебила...~
@2025 = ~Э-э, все отбросы Фаэруна собрались в одном месте. <CHARNAME>, не связывайся с этими имбецилами.~
@2026 = ~Упс.~
@2027 = ~Сэр? Успокойся, мы не те, кого ты ищешь.~
@2028 = ~(Начинает дрожать под взглядом Сандры и делает шаг назад.) Извини, миледи. ~
@2029 = ~Я недавно встречала твоего кузена Рубера в Вотердипе.~
@2030 = ~Этот молот, который ты носишь! Ты, должно быть, та женщина, которая заставила Рубера искупаться в гавани...~
@2031 = ~Тут тоже есть река...~
@2032 = ~Увидимся! Пока!~
@2033 = ~Если бы он умел владеть мечом хотя бы вполовину того, как языком, он был бы поистине чудесным существом.~
@2034 = ~НУ НАКОНЕЦ ТО! Клянусь, если он скажет ещё что-нибудь, я его убью!~
@2035 = ~Kaishas, do you take us all for fools? I knew you were werewolves before we even spoke to Karoug... frankly we were already suspicious within five minutes of entering the village! If you are going to try to kill us then go right ahead, but give us some credit for intelligence!~
@2036 = ~Have faith, there will be a cure for your soul, my friend.~
@2037 = ~Sharkta Fai, the Stormhorns, but even you do not know where that is...~
@2038 = ~Похоже, кто-то послал наёмного убийцу по твоему следу.~
@2039 = ~Весь в шрамах. Как ищейка.~
@2040 = ~You see and hear a lot of what happens around here, right?~
@2041 = ~And I sell everything that anybody around here may want.~
@2042 = ~And you got yourself a deal if you tell us about that strange man's burnt house not so long ago.~
@2043 = ~And I tell you he did it himself, who knows why, but he did.~
@2044 = ~And you surely have good reason to think so.~
@2045 = ~And I tell you why would anybody just dig a hole to bury his belongings in just one night before his house is destroyed - with no corpse found inside and the man gone.~
@2046 = ~And probably someone who sees him put things in said hole can go there and dig them out again.~
@2047 = ~And I tell you if that were the case, a dead man don't need worthless stuff himself anymore. Nothing of worth and all sold if you claim something.~
@2048 = ~And just books and such, sold on already, I guess.~
@2049 = ~And I tell you peddlers come through from Waterdeep that always give you a coin to sell that grub for good money to the bookworms up there.~
@2050 = ~And they enjoy business with you just as much as we do.~
@2051 = ~And probably someone who sees him put things in hole can go there and dig them out again.~
@2052 = ~From the west it came, and then the south. The east held it next, and now it rests in the north.~
@2053 = ~It began with you and your need for a home. It grew with your clan, as you feared losing them. It manifested in the invaders that came, but you feared their coming already. It became your home, where it keeps you safe.~
@2054 = ~The blame begins with the invaders, but they attacked with supposed good reason. It could be on your people, but they were in the shelter of your confidence. The craftsmen only did their jobs as directed. In your eyes, you are the one to blame for all that has happened.~
@2055 = ~If men are so pathetic, why did you choose only them for your game. Are you afraid to get into a real fight with a strong opponent. ~
@2056 = ~Like whom, like you little weekend warrior princess - with your playtoy hammer and your designer shop armour. I bet you wet your silk panties when you see a hobgoblin.~
@2057 = ~Which means any hobgoblin would scare me more than you do. At least my silk panties are currently dry like the Calimsha Desert.~
@2058 = ~With your big words that could make one start to weep if they were not so laughable, you could almost get along for a male. When stupidity is the criteria for gender, I mean.~
@2059 = ~If could get along as male, then why not extend your bet to include me. Just to teach me a lesson, maybe? ~
@2060 = ~Tell you what bigmouth. I now would love to wiggle this toy hammer out of your hand and then put you across my lap for a nice little spanking of your silken panties. They will be wet pretty soon. You arrogant rich bitch girls are no better than those male 'cavaliers'. Ha, another 20 gold easily gained and such fun on top of it. Let's go!~
@2061 = ~Like whom, like you little weekend warrior princess - with your play toy hammer and your designer shop armour. I bet you wet your silk panties when you see a hobgoblin.~
@2062 = ~Which means any hobgoblin would scare me more than you do. At least my silk panties are currently as dry as the Calimsha Desert.~
@2063 = ~If I could get along as male, then why not extend your bet to include me. Just to teach me a lesson, maybe? ~
@2064 = ~(Firebead looks at Sandrah, puzzled for a second.) ~
@2065 = ~Sandrah, now I recognise you. The world is small, I would never have expected to meet you with <CHARNAME>. Anyway, I have received a very strange scroll carried by a dead duergar slave that was found by farmers in the wilderness nearby recently. It may be of interest to your father. If you chance to meet him these days, just show it to him. I sense something demonic on it, so I put it into a chest upstairs. With your abilities you may carry it with you, I do not dare to do this myself. ~
@2066 = ~You're welcome, Firebead. We will do as you say. In a chest just upstairs... ~
@2067 = ~Good day, dear friend. My father sent us to retrieve a mysterious scroll you have recently found.~
@2068 = ~In deed, the thing was carried by a dead duergar slave that was found by farmers in the wilderness nearby. I sense something demonic on it, so I put it into a chest upstairs. With your abilities you may carry it with you, I did not dare to do this myself. ~
@2069 = ~(Ты выжидающе смотришь на Сандру. Знает ли этот грубый маг твою компаньонку, как все другие маги, которых вы встречали раньше?)~
@2070 = ~Клянусь силой Мистры! Пусть Метеор Мелфа сожжёт этот дом, если это не Эл...~
@2071 = ~Талантир, успокойся, да это я.~
@2072 = ~Девочка, как ты выросла. (Ох, это то, что обычно старики говорят молодым - я уже стал таким старым?) Сандра, ты стала настоящей красавицей, какой этот дом ещё не видел!~
@2073 = ~А ты по-прежнему обаятельный маг, каким был всегда, Талантир, грубый снаружи и джентльмен в душе.~
@2074 = ~(Бормочет себе под нос) Меликамп, кто ещё мог попасть в такое затруднительное положение.~
@2075 = ~Сандра, ты, кажется, не очень-то рада снова меня увидеть, а?~
@2076 = ~Ах ты, дурак! Я очень рада видеть тебя живыми и здоровыми после этого неудачного эксперимента. И я виню себя за то, что до сих пор беспокоюсь о таком откровенном идиоте, как ты.~
@2077 = ~Это всё твоя вина, Сандра, ты решила бросить меня, так что мне ещё оставалось, кроме моих магических экспериментов?~
@2078 = ~Это не правда. Это мечта. Ты обвиняешь меня в своих сумасшедших попытках вмешаться в магию, которая тебе не по силам...~
@2079 = ~Эй, кто-нибудь принесёт несколько стульев и немного закусок? Это будет интересно... и надолго...~
@2080 = ~Моя маленькая Сандра, одно он сказал правильно. Ты виновата в том, что всё ещё беспокоишься об этом глупом мальчишке. Но кто я такой, чтобы критиковать? Думаю, я совершил ту же ошибку, снова простив его.~
@2081 = ~Ладно. (Обнимает Меликампа и целует его) Я рада, что с тобой всё в порядке, и Талантир здесь, чтобы присматривать за тобой. Я больше не буду этого делать. Прощай, Меликамп, я ухожу с тем, кто тебя спас, и кого ты забыл поблагодарить.~ ~Ладно. (Обнимает Меликампа и целует его.) Я рада, что с тобой всё в порядке, и Талантир здесь, чтобы присматривать за тобой. Я больше не буду этого делать. Прощай, Меликамп, я ухожу с той, кто тебя спасла, и кого ты забыл поблагодарить.~
@2082 = ~Но, дорогая...~
@2083 = ~<CHARNAME>, пожалуйста, давай поскорее уйдём отсюда, пока этот вечный подмастерье не попытался снова меня во что-нибудь впутать.~
@2084 = ~Greeting, Ajantis, will you really consider me as a foe? ~
@2085 = ~Lady Sandrah, is that really you? Oh, where are my manners, mylady, if you are with that party, their goal must be just - or at least not an evil one. ~
@2086 = ~(Walks up to Ajantis and kisses him on the cheek.) ~
@2087 = ~(Ajantis blushes to deep red) M-m-mylady! Please!!~
@2088 = ~(Giggles) Has-been lovers, haha, our cleric has a chequered past...~
@2089 = ~Ajantis, still the stiff little paladin-to-be? ~
@2090 = ~Lady Sandrah, you err, I'm no longer the little paladin-to-be you once knew, but a member of the order now, following Helm's righteous way.~
@2091 = ~That was more or less to be expected, Sir Ajantis, never taking even the slightest step from your designated path. ~
@2092 = ~Sorry, it is not Sir Ajantis - not yet - I am still waiting to be knighted, mylady. ~
@2093 = ~As no doubt you will. So, I am with the party of <CHARNAME> investigating the recent events on the Sword Coast.~
@2094 = ~I do not know about others in this party, but I will not let this opportunity pass. I'd buy one for my girl surely, good lady.~
@2095 = ~Minsc, Minsc, you know what wouldst be said about you at home for that...~
@2096 = ~They would joke about it with no end trying to betroth me to my sweet Sandrah right away.~
@2097 = ~So you would buy one for me then, Minsc?~
@2098 = ~You know so much, Sandrah, but maybe you know not all about Rashemen customs. It is for all loved girls at the Midsummer Festival in Rashemen to wear such a ribbon in their hair, given to them by their boy. Boo would be ashamed if our girl would be seen there without our colour in her hair.~
@2099 = ~A lovely custom, even if it is neither Midsummer nor we are near Rashemen. But one needs to be prepared. So which colour do I get from my Minsc?~
@2100 = ~Oh, my...hm. What do you say Boo? Red, as her mouth and the colour of a rose that she is? Too blatant?~
@2101 = ~Yellow, like the morning sun that lights everything just like she lights our day? Or maybe green like s spring day, fresh and new like herself.~
@2102 = ~Minsc, I will only wear one, otherwise all people would think I got multiple lovers, so you have to make up your mind.~
@2103 = ~There is a good reason for any of her colours. Setta, I buy that rainbow coloured one as my lady appears in a different way to me each time I look at her.~
@2104 = ~And each aspect is a lovely as the other, you lucky hero. Such a girl is worth to spend even the 150 Gold this rare ribbon will cost you. A rainbow ribbon is as rare as the girl you want to buy it for.~
@2105 = ~Thank you, my cavalier. I look ahead to the day I wear it for you at the Midsummer Festival in Rashemen jumping over the bonfire hand in hand with you. (She gives the happy warrior a kiss.)~
@2106 = ~I will buy a blue one for a very special girl~
@2107 = ~The colour of peace and the colour of soul.~
@2108 = ~This is the meaning it has for the elves as well. What suits the lady who brings me peace for my soul better? My healer, please give me the pleasure to accept it.~
@2109 = ~The ribbon and the promise that you give me with it - I accept them both with joy. (She embraces Kivan for a long kiss.)~
@2110 = ~White is the only colour that would suit the lady I will give it to.~
@2111 = ~Has white the same meaning for the elves than it has for us humans, Xan?~
@2112 = ~It stands for flawless beauty and perfection and is the only colour that can grace you, Sandrah.~
@2113 = ~(Laughs) I gladly accept that from you, Xan, thinking also it is the opposite of black, the opposite of hopelessness and depression. (Sandrah embraces and kisses the Moonblade Wielder.)~
@2114 = ~Быстрее, <CHARNAME>, никто не должен страдать только из-за своей расы.~
@2115 = ~Мы обязаны помочь ей, <CHARNAME>. Если ты спасаешь чью-то жизнь, ты обязан дать ей шанс найти способ её продолжить.~ ~Мы обязаны помочь ей, <CHARNAME>. Если ты спасаешь чью-то жизнь, ты обязана дать ей шанс найти способ её продолжить.~
@2116 = ~<CHARNAME>! ~
@2117 = ~Priestess, I recognise how you tried to bring this jaluk to <PRO_HISHER> senses. Maybe you will kill <PRO_HIMHER> soon to lead this group on. Take this from me - we two will meet again.~
@2118 = ~Ты хочешь убить её только потому, что она дроу? Что за закон ты представляешь?~
@2119 = ~Я здесь закон, и я приговариваю её к смерти - и всех, кто её защищает! Она убийца.~
@2120 = ~Убийца, потому что она дроу, или у тебя есть доказательства её преступлений?~
@2121 = ~Отойди в сторону, я не с тобой разговариваю. Она должна быть казнена.~
@2122 = ~Сначала тебе придётся пройти через нас. Это не справедливо, то что ты делаешь. Убийца здесь ты, независимо от того, какую ты носишь эмблему.~
@2123 = ~Помоги ей, и ты падёшь вместе с ней!~
@2124 = ~Я благодарю тебя за твою помощь, возможно, наши пути ещё когда-нибудь пересекутся.~
@2125 = ~You better give to us what you have stolen or you will feel the anger of a Goddess that only laughs about such as Umberlee and Talos. ~
@2126 = ~Hell, Sonner the witch knows. ~
@2127 = ~We had lots of trouble with a young priestess of Umberlee seeking revenge on us 'cos we had to kill her mother. That Talos priest told us we need to do it to get his god's favour. So what? We are caught in a tangle of gods playing with us. ~
@2128 = ~I suppose I have little choice then.  I've had the evidence for Talos on me the entire time; we felt it was safest that way.~
@2129 = ~Give them the bowl, they may know how to becalm Umberlee, I'd say.~
@2130 = ~Take it, but know that the Storm Lord knows who it is that opposes him.~
@2131 = ~Now you best get out of here.  I should stay well away from any Talos shrine if I were you.  Vengeful things these gods.~
@2132 = ~Райкен, вау, парень, ты теперь добился успеха, это впечатляет. (Никогда в жизни не думала, что смогу так врать.)~
@2133 = ~Сандра, принцесса Вотердипа, наконец-то ты обратила на меня внимание. Я знал, что обретение богатства в конце концов обеспечит мне лучших девушек.~
@2134 = ~Видишь эту группу со мной? Думаю, ты и твой босс не хотите, чтобы такие, как мы, выступали против них, милый.~
@2135 = ~Ты нам угрожаешь, девочка с молотком, берегитесь!~
@2136 = ~Ой, перень, я действительно тебе нужна. Кто-то ведь должен думать. Мы, разумеется, хотим быть с тобой, разве ты не понимаешь, иначе зачем бы мы сюда пришли? Тазок будет рад видеть нас среди своих. Я даже думаю, что он может назначит тебя моим командиром.~
@2137 = ~Ха, быть твоим командиром! Угадай, какой будет тебе мой первый приказ. Я знал, что в конце концов, ты будешь ползать за мной, как и все. Ну, пошли.~
@2138 = ~(Плюёт на землю, когда Райкен поворачивается спиной) Фу, неужели бывают девушки, которые так низко себя ведут, как этот придурок думает, что буду я?~
@2139 = ~Тевен, вау, парень, ты теперь добился успеха, это впечатляет. С твоим талантом к магии - однажды это должно было произойти. (Никогда в жизни не думала, что смогу так врать.)~
@2140 = ~(Плюёт на землю, когда Тевен поворачивается спиной) Фу, неужели бывают девушки, которые так низко себя ведут, как этот придурок думает, что буду я?~
@2141 = ~(Sandrah has taken Kivan's hand and presses it reassuringly).~
@2142 = ~This time, Tazok, I am not helplessly bound and I have an arrow with your heart's name on it.~
@2143 = ~And you are not alone this time.~
@2144 = ~With you at my side I feel like the strongest man on Toril, mellamina. Even if it is my last day on this plane.~
@2145 = ~It will be the first day of the newly born Kivan of Shilmista, (whispers), my love.~
@2146 = ~This guy seems to know nothing of interest.~
@2147 = ~Aarg, the dreaded Red Head. Let me get outa here!~
@2148 = ~That name know only the orcs that got Henning! Speak where is he? I beat the words outa you, you ugly dwarf if I must.~
@2149 = ~PLEASE, no need for torture, ask them arrested in the cave just north, I know nothing, PLEASE.~
@2150 = ~You smell terrible with your soiled pants, leave quickest before I change my mind. And no word to no one or I'll get ya after all.~
@2151 = ~No word!~
@2152 = ~You smell terrible with your soiled pants, leave quickest before I change my mind. And no word to no one or I'll get ya after all. ~
@2153 = ~Опять Клоаквуд. Значит, теперь у нас две причины поскорее туда добраться. Это хорошо!~
@2154 = ~Имоен, или Рыжая, как называют тебя враги.~
@2155 = ~Эльф, ты видел моего Хеннинга, да? С ним всё в порядке, да? Он знает, что я иду, да? Эльф, ты будешь говорть, да?~
@2156 = ~Да, да, да и да.~
@2157 = ~А?~
@2158 = ~Если ты дашь мне возможность ответить, то да. Твой парень был здесь два дня назад. Они держали его со мной здесь, в палатке. Тазок приказал лидеру орков быстрее идти со своим заложником в Клоаквуд. Он боялся, что вы найдёте его здесь, и из-за Хеннинга будет слишком много проблем. Твой парень немного побит, но относительно невредим. Он не грудной младенец, его дух непоколебим.~
@2159 = ~Ох, мой бедный любимый. Он вынужден всё это терпеть из-за меня. Спасибо, эльф, я благодарю тебя за эти новости. (Она целует в щёку удивлённого эльфа.)~
@2160 = ~Имя Даваэорн что-нибудь тебе говорит?~
@2161 = ~Я подозреваю, что это тот, кто управляет шахтой в Клоуквуде, начальник Тазока. Тебе следует обыскать этот закрытый сундук с бумагами Тазока. Я уверен, там ты найдёшь больше, чем я могу тебе рассказать.~
@2162 = ~А где орки со своим пленником?~
@2163 = ~Out with it quickest, man!~
@2164 = ~They keep the orcs in their own quarter at the prison level. Scares dem prisoners like mad to have that bunch next door, haha.~
@2165 = ~Did you see their prisoner with them? Did they deliver him to Davaeorn?~
@2166 = ~They brought a human with 'em, just two days ago. But not for the boss. The orcs keep 'im in their quarters. Must be the prisoner for someone else, boss is not interested in him.~
@2167 = ~Do not worry, Imoen, we will see him pretty soon and he will tell us all about the background of his kidnapping himself.~
@2168 = ~Imoen? I'm out of here! The redhead!~
@2169 = ~Wow, my Henning must tell 'em quite some stories about me. I'll needa have a word with him, I guess. They all act like I'm a devil in person.~
@2170 = ~Yes, it better end soon. This smell when they wet their pants on hearing your name really starts to hurt my nose.~
@2171 = ~Noo!~
@2172 = ~DADDY!~
@2173 = ~Imoen, darling, --- hey, what was it you said. It's me, ol' Puffguts. <CHARNAME>, whatcha done to my lil' one out there, how many ogres have knocked her on her red head?~
@2174 = ~Oh, my bestest puffing daddy, let me kiss and kiss ya quickest. (She embraces the innkeeper whose eyes are already wet with tears.)~
@2175 = ~Yes, yes, yes, I love you, too, my little Immi and you were missed much.~
@2176 = ~Oh, there is so much I have learned out there, daddy, so much about me and so much about you - how good you really have been for taking one such as me and all.~
@2177 = ~(Winthrop all of a sudden seems to change completely, his shoulders straighten and he seems to grow in height. His normally jolly face becomes grave.)~
@2178 = ~No need to worry, see yourself, <CHARNAME> and me handle that together, no bloody dead god gets to rule us from his grave, no and no.~
@2179 = ~Well, you two, the day had to come, we knew it, Gorion and me. And it became a fact the day that letter from Elminster came and then you. (He turns to Sandrah.) ~
@2180 = ~Yes, I was with them all the time, as my father and even more my mother Khalindra are much involved in this as well.~
@2181 = ~Elminster's firstborn, Sandrah, you haven't told me that when you came to leave the weapon for <CHARNAME>. Secretive like your father thou art.~
@2182 = ~Well, you two, the day had to come, we knew it, Gorion and me. And it became a fact the day that letter from Elminster came.~
@2183 = ~That's why you let me go so easily with <PRO_HIMHER>, right? First I was a bit pissed for not being really searched after, but now I understand. I understand so much and much now. Daddy.~
@2184 = ~(They hold each other in their arms for a long time. It looks to you as if they communicate without any words and both seem to understand everything.)~
@2185 = ~We need to go now, daddy. There is still the end of this plot waiting for us and the villains are right here in Candlekeep.~
@2186 = ~The Iron Throne leaders are in the library. It's those you seek. Seems a bit of useless to say this, but please be careful.~
@2187 = ~Sure we will. I needa present your son-in-law to you still, next time we come around...~
@2188 = ~My son-in... Well, the day had to come, I shoulda known it...tututu, Imoen.~
@2189 = ~It is as we expected, Sarevok, oh, yes Koveras spelled backwards, really wants to use us to eliminate the Iron Throne leaders for him. The ring of one of the victims to be found on his supposed murderer later on. A clumsy plan that shows us we have a good chance against this opponent.~
@2190 = ~You then must be this mysterious advisor for Gorion's ward, who is reported to cause so much damage to the Iron Throne's operations.~
@2191 = ~And to your operations, I assume, if you know those reports so well.~
@2192 = ~Your choice of the wrong advisers, <CHARNAME>, has led you into this trouble and it will lead you to your downfall if you continue to follow this lying witch.~
@2193 = ~The words of the cornered rat seeking for any chance to escape the fate that is obvious. This here will not be the location to seal your destruction, Sarevok. We will not be the scapegoats in your wicked plan.~
@2194 = ~You may consider yourself clever, but you are no match for the powers at work here, silly child.~
@2195 = ~Since when do you have those green eyes, my *grandfather*?~
@2196 = ~Come closer to me and to the light, child, so I may see which grandchild is talking to me.~
@2197 = ~Oh, you have so many that little *Pippy* has surely slipped your mind.~
@2198 = ~Спасибо за тёплый приём, Налин.~
@2199 = ~Если это не Эл...мпф.~
@2200 = ~(Сандра быстро подходит к молодому красивому священнику и заставляет его замолчать поцелуем.)~
@2201 = ~Это было... Однако, добро пожаловать в храм.~
@2202 = ~Ha, I doubt you will be very much welcome there. Unless your pockets are filled with gold to pay all your lenders you left behind after your bankruptcy.~
@2203 = ~Even my superiors at the temple gave this man some credit before he was finally found out.~
@2204 = ~The hardships one must endure! The Sword Coast is not far enough from Waterdeep to remain unnoticed for long.~
@2205 = ~Silly to think you can escape the eyes of Helm or Elminster, dumb imposter.~
@2206 = ~I better get out of here quick.~
@2207 = ~(Drizzt jumps away and out of reach of Sandrah's hammer.)~
@2208 = ~But then you have the great mages own daughter at your side, so I sense you will know well which path to take, my friend. The friend of all who tread the good road has taught her well. But, girl, put that hammer away. (laughs kindly.)~
@2209 = ~May the peace you seek so hard be with you, friendly drow.~
@2210 = ~Drizzt, you seek out our humble little party for an adventure at your side! What an honor, <CHARNAME>.~
@2211 = ~The pleasure is mine, Sandrah, to have my most talented student ever by my side. Sadly enough, it is not only pleasure but also need that makes me appeal to the most heroic party on the Sword Coast today.~
@2212 = ~Rather than to wait for some far away treasures that may or may not exist, I would be interested in that wine - and especially the dessert thereafter - right here and now.~
@2213 = ~Wow, an unexpected offer from a lady who could not be expected to come into such quarters very often.  How about moving over to the fireplace, mylady, and exploring our possibilities in more depth.~
@2214 = ~A splendid thought, dear friend, let us not hesitate. ~
@2215 = ~....~
@2216 = ~Будь осторожен, маг.~
@2217 = ~Проклятие, дочка могучего мага собственной персоной. ОН вмешивается везде и повсюду.~
@2218 = ~<CHARNAME>, я советую отнестись к его предложению с максимальным подозрением. Однако, мне любопытно узнать, что его хитрый маленький ум приготовил для нас.~
@2219 = ~Ох, проклятый Эл...~
@2220 = ~НИ СЛОВА БОЛЬШЕ!~
@2221 = ~Хмм.~
@2222 = ~Миледи? Возможно, ты знаешь эти истории лучше меня?~
@2223 = ~Ха, да, я понимаю, ты действительно можешь их знать, извини, миледи Сандра.~
@2224 = ~Не волнуйся, мастер Воло, любые истории звучат значительно лучше, когда их рассказываешь ты.~
@2225 = ~В твоём голосе и краешке глаза есть немного иронии.~
@2226 = ~Лишь комплимент от всего сердца, добрый Воло, мне всегда нравились твои истории в Вотердипе.~
@2227 = ~Что же касается краешка глаза, Воло, ты стоишь слишком далеко, чтобы действительно видеть, что там.~
@2228 = ~Совершенно верно, миледи. (Воло приближается к Сандре и делает вид, что изучает один её глаз.) Ладно, теперь я вижу, что это...~
@2229 = ~Ну что же, мой опытный путешественник?~
@2230 = ~Твой всемогущий отец вне поля зрения на этот раз, ладно... Как говорится от Калимшана до Субара, *Или ты, или я*, миледи...~
@2231 = ~Кобольды! Отойди, старик, и держись за нами...~
@2232 = ~Спасибо, искатели приключений. Я... я нашёл этот драгоценный камень при добыче руды... я хранил его для моей леди, но... вы спасли мне жизнь, и мне нечем больше заплатить вам за вашу храбрость...~
@2233 = ~Тогда отдай его своей леди, мой друг. А теперь уходи, пока не появились новые «демоны».~
@2234 = ~Но твоя жизнь - для неё достаточный подарок. Спасибо за драгоценный камень.~
@2235 = ~Ты всё ещё здесь, трус? Убирайся с глаз моих, пока я сам тебя не убил. Ха, испугался кобольдов!~ ~Ты всё ещё здесь, трус? Убирайся с глаз моих, пока я сама тебя не убила. Ха, испугался кобольдов!~
@2236 = ~Постарайся держаться в тени и попроси стражников проводить тебя на поверхность.~
@2237 = ~Я сделаю это, добрая священница. Я скажу стражникам и самому хозяину Эмерсону, какие вы храбрые. Надеюсь, вы быстро убьёте всех монстров внизу - нам нужно зарабатывать себе на жизнь.~
@2238 = ~В любом случае, ты унаследовал один из предметов Горайона, который ещё не раскрыл свою истинную природу.~ ~В любом случае, ты унаследовала один из предметов Горайона, который ещё не раскрыл свою истинную природу.~
@2239 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are a beast to leave an unarmed captured woman in a hole like this! The minimum I expected from you was to take her safely to Nashkel.~
@2240 = ~I have come to possess an item I wanted to debate with you, cleric girl. I ask you to take into your custody for the moment. ~
@2241 = ~And is there more you can tell me about it, where did you for example get it from?~
@2242 = ~ I found it near a place thine folk call the Firewine. But it must have been lost in older times, me guesses at the end of the Time of Troubles...Thou priestess should know the lore, or so I hope. That is all to say for now. Keep it safe, I beg of thee.~
@2243 = ~Судя по твоему акценту, ты из Рашемена.~
@2244 = ~Ты права и хорошо образована, юная священница, я Динахейр, ведьма из Рашемена.~
@2245 = ~Так далеко от твоего дома, я полагаю, у тебя дажемма?~
@2246 = ~О, время моей дажеммы прошло. Вичаларн отправили меня на Побережье Меча в поисках других знаний. Но здесь и сейчас не место и не время для долгих размышлений. Мы можем вернуться к этой теме, когда узнаем друг друга получше.~
@2247 = ~Согласна. Я с нетерпением буду ждать возможности обменяться знаниями, которыми мы обе можем получить из текущих и прошлых записях по этому поводу.~
@2248 = ~(Ты видишь, что Динахейр на мгновение озадаченно смотрит на Сандру. Кажется, что между этими двумя женщинами есть что-то общее, что ускользает от твоего внимания.)~
@2249 = ~For how long have you been in this forsaken place already, you look as if it were a lifetime?~
@2250 = ~I guide the caravans and travellers safely through these roads.~
@2251 = ~Caravans, roads, traveller, wonder if there's been one of 'em round here ever since the Time of Troubles. ~
@2252 = ~He has seen no caravan round here since you or me were born.~
@2253 = ~I was guarding and guarding them. Where are they now? This is all I have found of them when they were gone that night.~
@2254 = ~Poor man, have you been here ever since you lost that fated caravan so long ago? ~
@2255 = ~I hear them cry, the poor babies, where are they now - do not doubt my words fools, I am the greatest fighter on the Sword Coast.~
@2256 = ~I am afraid we just witnessed one of his last moments of clearness. His mind is incurable gone.~
@2257 = ~Drienne, do you have any idea who killed your cat, maybe some smelly frightening creatures not from around here. ~
@2258 = ~Others than those smelly frightening gnolls, yes, maybe the ones in the cave, all glowing eyes and smelling hellish, maybe they killed little Pixie.~
@2259 = ~Я надеюсь, что вы сможете мне помочь, будьте любезны, взгляните на это. (Сандра подходит к Таэрому и расстегивает платье у воротника.)~
@2260 = ~Миледи, это очень интересный... эм... амулет, на самом деле...~
@2261 = ~Единственная проблема в том, что на нём есть маленькое пятно, возможно немного ржавчины.~
@2262 = ~Ах да, я заметил маленькое пятно... да... позвольте мне взглянуть поближе, миледи.~
@2263 = ~Да, мастер кузнец, я знала, что вы заметите проблему и сможете мне помочь.~
@2264 = ~Если вы не против, пожалуйста, миледи, следуйте за мной в заднюю комнату, мне нужен специальный... э... *инструмент* для решения данной проблемы.~
@2265 = ~Конечно, дорогой мастер, я была уверена, что у вас найдётся подходящий *инструмент* для этого... (Сандра следует за Таэромом в заднюю комнату кузницы.)~
@2266 = ~(Когда через некоторое время они возвращаются, ты замечаешь, что кузнец, должно быть, много работал.)~
@2267 = ~Спасибо, Таэром, хорошая работа. Вы ловкий джентльмен, я вернусь, когда у меня возникнут такие проблемы.~
@2268 = ~Всегда пожалуйста, миледи. (Кузнец подмигивает Сандре.)~
@2269 = ~Добрый день, мастер Таэром.~
@2270 = ~Миледи, вы снова великолепно выглядите, ваш восстановленный... эм... амулет, вам очень идёт...~
@2271 = ~Ох, добрый мастер, если бы я могла сказать то же самое об остальных моих вещах.~
@2272 = ~Я могу вам чем-то помочь, миледи Сандра?~
@2273 = ~Надеюсь, что да, Таэром, застёжка моего пояса как-то плохо работает.~
@2274 = ~(Смотрит на свои инструменты.) У меня просто нет подходящего оборудования, подождите минутку...~
@2275 = ~(Сандра следует за кузнецом в боковую комнату, где он, кажется, ищет подходящие инструменты, чтобы помочь ей с её поясом...)~
@2276 = ~Нет проблем, леди Сандра, я всегда рад помочь с вашими маленькими проблемами...~
@2277 = ~I understand, master Scar, that you wanted to give me something that my father has left in your care?~
@2278 = ~My lady Sandrah? Eh - oh, yes, yes, that little, eh, something. I think I have left it in my quarter, just...~
@2279 = ~It is probably best I just come with you to retrieve it, spares you one way, dear master.~
@2280 = ~Eh, yes (blush), sure, this way...~
@2281 = ~Master Scar, did you have time meanwhile to find the little something we could not locate last time?~
@2282 = ~Oh, well, yes, I have it now. Hm, oh yes it must be on my bedside table, if you could...~
@2283 = ~Yes, let us go and get it right now.~
@2284 = ~Sure, this...you know the way by now, Sandrah.~
@2285 = ~My lady, we are acquainted to serve customers of every class and variety here, but rarely in my years have I encountered a lady of such distinction and beauty.~
@2286 = ~Thank you very much, kind sir, you flatter me in a much welcome way, if I may say.~
@2287 = ~While your companions may enjoy themselves on cost of the house, may I take the freedom to show you a bit of the specialities I have gathered over time?~
@2288 = ~It would be indeed a welcome excuse from the daily routine, for which your establishment has a reputation beyond the city's walls.~
@2289 = ~This is quite a compliment from a lady of the world like you~
@2290 = ~This really destroys all my hopes I had for a possible relationship, dearest mage?~
@2291 = ~Uh, Sandrah, our relationship, eh, what?~
@2292 = ~How could I ever dream to compete with the beauties of the Blushing Mermaid or the Undercellars. Your taste in women is for those at a level I can never reach.~
@2293 = ~Your training with the smith of Beregost and others may help...~
@2294 = ~Still I am afraid I can never reach the level you prefer in women. I wonder how any girl can ever sink so low.~
@2295 = ~Surely not one like you, my lady.~
@2296 = ~I would rather wish you attempted to molest me, bigot fool, so I could claim the right to defend myself.~
@2297 = ~Such rage from one who is righteous herself? ~
@2298 = ~A girl in the ranks of the flaming fist, what do you say now, wildcat.~
@2299 = ~Paah, and see what she has to do, deliver unimportant messages like any errand boy could do. Say, do you see much fighting, Laola?~
@2300 = ~Not, yet, I am pretty new in the Fist.~
@2301 = ~Fighting off those male pigs in the barracks will keep you busy at least.~
@2302 = ~It's not that bad, I mean it happens even in the Fist, but not worse than anywhere else.~
@2303 = ~Could only mean you haven't met the worst swine of them all, Angelo Dosan.~
@2304 = ~Psst, you shouldn't insult Commander Dosan...~
@2305 = ~Ha, *Commander* Dosan, by the Iron Throne's grace. Didn't I promise it, pussycat, he can be found with the scum trying to make his profit, this bastard.~
@2306 = ~You are insulting a high officer of the...~
@2307 = ~Don't wet your panties about it, girlie soldier, I can talk about my father how I want. And now  piss off.~
@2308 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, let us leave this guy to dwell in his boredom. It was society people like this who drove me off to the road. Them and my family blood, that is.~
@2309 = ~They drove you right into <CHARNAME>'s arms, so you shoulda thank 'em instead of blamin', haha.~
@2310 = ~I would sure like to crush that nasty mage to shreds, by Tempus. His magic will be of no use to him this time as I am not caught unaware like last time. Let us not hesitate any longer, my friends.~
@2311 = ~(Имоен пожимает руку Сандре с яркой улыбкой на лице.) Приятно познакомиться, Сандра, вау, какой красивый халатик, жаль, что он совсем не розовый.~
@2312 = ~(Имоен кивает на эти слова.) Увидишь.~
@2313 = ~I am beat by such a tiny warrior imitation like you? How is that. Well, I will find out soon enough, as I stand by my word. <CHARNAME>, you command my sword arm as of now.~
@2314 = ~We will see your worth soon. But do not sulk too much, you have been beaten by Sandrah, one of the best fighters of the Sword Coast, whatever your prejudice against her looks might have suggested. ~
@2315 = ~Be sure I will study your strange cleric fighter girl carefully. The time in your pathetic group seems to hold no other visible pleasure for me anyway. ~
@2316 = ~Терьеры чуют крыс, Имоен тоже. Я никогда не видела ни одного наёмного убийцу за всю свою жизнь, но я чувствую их запах инстинктивно. Кто его прислал?~
@2317 = ~It is an odd place, to be sure. Teleportations are affected most drastically in effect trapping the occasional passing mage. Those that are there will find their way off in time. Those that are not there any more have found their own way off. I think you will agree that the ones that you met were not inclined to work together and effect their own release. An excellent judge of character in a supposedly natural phenomenon, wouldn't you say? I must be off. Fare ye well. ~
@2318 = ~Travellers, I recognized again the devilish mage's presence in your companion. But I also sense you have an item of interest for me as well. So now...Whatever you do, do not give a certain book to anyone who asks you for it, you will certainly be betrayed.~
@2319 = ~Ha, the stupid mortal wench could not hold on to that jar. She has not delivered my name but failed nevertheless.~
@2320 = ~A homesick demon, can you really believe this? ~
@2321 = ~Demon hunting is the funnest of funs. Let's get out and do some more. Watch out, demons I will get me a peanut sling...~
@2322 = ~A male demon, how pathetic. Even down there in hell males are nothing but stupid scum. ~
@2323 = ~A male, no doubt. But even unusable as a slave. What a waste. ~
@2324 = ~Just to think that such creatures are considered the threat of Shilmista - one never finishes learning. ~
@2325 = ~(Scribble, scribble) Oh no, I have no idea how I can put this into words. The heroic deed reads just like a joke, oh my. ~
@2326 = ~Once again evil has been smashed! Well, *smashed* may not be the right word. But then, even a peanut can smite evil when thrown by the hand of the righteous. ~
@2327 = ~Well, I am not sure if we want this adventure spread in a bardsong through the realms. But maybe it can be used on stage - for a comedy. ~
@2328 = ~A foe is defeated. Victory asks not for method to achieve it.~
@2329 = ~Oh, my lady, if I only once had the courage and energy to act out with such strength for the good, instead of faltering in indecision.~
@2330 = ~Sandrah, thou arest the strangest kind of paladin one can imagine - but 'tis said that your goddess is different from others as well.~
@2331 = ~Buzzurk! How many beers did I have last night? Hit me with Clangeddin's Axe, I need to wake up. ~
@2332 = ~Ты уверена, что в душе ты не дикий маг, Сандра?~
@2333 = ~Не дикий маг, но женщина, которая временами бывает дикой.~
@2334 = ~Что? Ни честного боя, ни кровопролития? Клянусь Темпусом, это демоны для младенцев.~
@2335 = ~Это славная победа, но всё же это иллюзия. Он вернётся, и все мы будем обречены.~
@2336 = ~Such intelligence in a woman is both admirable and dangerous (I need to get this pet under my thumb soon.)~
@2337 = ~This lair is now ours to loot. The whole thing reminds me of a story I once encountered with the daughter of...ah..maybe another time...  ~
@2338 = ~ Well,
The mighty mage's courageous daughter,
Trying to avoid a slaughter,
Defeated the demon with a yell,
Telling him to GO TO HELL.~
@2339 = ~An unconventional way to solve problems, you are full of surprises, Sandrah. ~
@2340 = ~There has been nothing alike this deed in the happenings from the times of Raumathar and Narfell until present days.~
@2341 = ~The balance is restored again that was disturbed by this presence on the surface. Let us move, <CHARNAME>. ~
@2342 = ~(Fiercely) You are fool to think you can fool a demon, woman.~
@2343 = ~I wonder if he will come back? ~
@2344 = ~Oh, my lovely competent leader, what is your plan? ~
@2345 = ~Let us go buy some pink balloons and some ribbons for the girls, and then we could...~
@2346 = ~There sure is some arena around here where we can train on some male scum. Ha, all aboard for funtime! ~
@2347 = ~Another strange surfacer habit, these carnivals. But there seem to be a lot of willing males in the crowd. Excuse me, I think I spied a really decent prey...~
@2348 = ~My heart bursts in remembering the Daoine Teague Feer, the great celebration of Shilmista. ~
@2349 = ~This is not as sacred as the Feer, but maybe you will remember it once as well with joy - as a moment you have spent with one you loved.~
@2350 = ~(Kivan wordlessly kisses Sandrah. He has a small tear in his eye.)~
@2351 = ~Hey, I have not been to a fair since I left Waterdeep. I'll ride that wheel and see the town from a much higher perspective, hihi. Books are kept closed for tonight. ~
@2352 = ~Friends, do not be too careless in this crowd. Evil loves to hide in places where people are enjoying their leisure too much. ~
@2353 = ~My, there is a bard's competition over there on the stage just starting. I expect you all to cheer for me! ~
@2354 = ~I'm sure sooner or later I will find my brother Jolun here in the crowd, enjoying himself with some girl probably.~
@2355 = ~Buzzurk! Do what you want. You will find me in the Drakon Tavern over there with a good beer, once you have finished your childish amusements. ~
@2356 = ~A place where Sune's spirit becomes visible even to those not following her faith!~
@2357 = ~Jen'lig remembers celebration of coming to maturity. Only festival for Githyanki.~
@2358 = ~By Tempus, we have deserved this. Let us show them how heroes can celebrate. ~
@2359 = ~This whole installation is just an illusion created to let us forget doom for a few quickly passing hours. ~
@2360 = ~Then sweet elf let us do just that, forget doom and enjoy the illusion as if it were real. Nothing of it can hurt us, right?~
@2361 = ~Haha, all these willing dumb women just waiting for the master to teach them tonight. (Damned, if I could only get this arrogant wonderful Waterdeep pussy into a state to recognize my qualities...chances may be good tonight...) ~
@2362 = ~Purses and more purses. Women and girls and more girls and more women. Where to start... ~
@2363 = ~A welcome change from our usual life on the road. A tradition only too rare in my suffering homeland. But we canst enjoy a day if the chance appears.~
@2364 = ~Boo has reminded Minsc about the good tradition for us fighters of Rashemen to celebrate with mead our victories.~
@2365 = ~Oh, I fear the worst, Minsc always gets drunk heavily on such occasions and will be unusable the next day. But he never learns.~
@2366 = ~Do not worry, Dynaheir. I will gladly celebrate with our courageous protector and my healing skills will help us avoid the consequences afterwards. Let everybody enjoy the day.~
@2367 = ~Blind citizens. I pity them for the artificial joys they need to install, never getting the chance of dwelling in nature's endless celebration and beauty. ~
@2368 = ~Look at that merchant, <CHARNAME>. On an occasion like this your girl should receive a nice ribbon for her hair.~
@2369 = ~Do not be too selfish, Sandrah, I will buy one for each girl in the party.~
@2370 = ~(The world around does no longer exist at this moment..)  ~
@2371 = ~Huuh, Huh, lovee dovees, watcha doing while all of us are waiting. Oh healer, please, I need help, hahaha...~
@2372 = ~How pathetic. Can you not even be decent enough to go beneath the blankets. Think I must throw up.. ~
@2373 = ~Which of my sisters taught you in these arts, Sandrah? <CHARNAME>, remember you have another healer in your group if it REALLY hurts. (Licks her lips seductively.) ~
@2374 = ~What a lovely scene, oh how I yearn for the forests of Shilmista and my beloved Deheriana to do the same. ~
@2375 = ~(Scribble, scribble) Hups, I have not misplaced my notepad around here, no probably not. ~
@2376 = ~Oh, ehem, sorry, milady. I did not recognise you were behind that tree. (The color of his face could be named as *purple*.)~
@2377 = ~Just call on me if you need some romantic music to accompany you. ~
@2378 = ~Buzzurk! Can this not wait until we get to a decent inn, so the rest of us can get a cool nice beer while you do whatever you want to do. ~
@2379 = ~I always wish I could my courage together and make such a move myself. Looks as if I have to be the bystander again.~
@2380 = ~Mammals at play not much different from Githyanki. Jen'lig misses being pleasured this way.~
@2381 = ~By Tempus, you are lucky to be still alive. I heard a rumour in these bushes and just wanted to behead some nasty gibberlings. ~
@2382 = ~Oh, this young love on the eve of doom. Keep on with it while you still can. Too sad there is no tomorrow for you and all of us. ~
@2383 = ~Want me to join. I learned the Thay type of massage from a lady I met in...ah, no, I think it was...Never mind. ~
@2384 = ~Thou are not aware of the presence of danger, but thou shouldst.~
@2385 = ~Our competent leader through this wilderness and <PRO_HISHER> likely competent counsellor, see, see. I assume you two are taking special training in survival. Ha! (Stamps away angrily.) Let us move, <CHARNAME>. ~
@2386 = ~A few lines to add to my heroine's epic...the aspects of  romance in between the great deeds.~
@2387 = ~(I hope she'll recognise my limping tomorrow - I must arrange a similar scene for us.)~
@2388 = ~The Lady Firehair can be worshipped in many ways (Smile).~
@2389 = ~(Sigh). Too good we have caring companions with us. ~
@2390 = ~Чего же ты медлишь, в воду, ныряй...~
@2391 = ~Ура, побежали - кто последний, того намочим!~
@2392 = ~Ох, эти жалкие люди. Под доспехами они могут спрятать хоть часть этого!~
@2393 = ~Если солнечный свет меня не убьёт, значит, убьёт вода. Однако, если на то будет воля Шар, я переживу все эти испытания.~
@2394 = ~Сандра, маленькая эльфийка в душе, я чувствую себя светлячком, танцующим над озером под полуденным солнцем. ~
@2395 = ~Нет, нет, я не буду ничего записывать про эту сцену.~
@2396 = ~Должно быть, эту сцену нам устроила леди Огневолосая.~
@2397 = ~Если это не самая дикая магия, тогда я не знаю что.~
@2398 = ~(Это шанс показать принцессе, что на самом деле нужно исследовать под красной мантией - если бы она хоть раз посмотрела в мою сторону. Немного брызг может помочь...)~
@2399 = ~Нет, Бу остается на пляже, твоя шерсть промокнет и взъерошится, и потом ты пожалеешь. И уйди с солнца, тебе слишком жарко. Что? - Да, я тебе приказываю. Я делаю то, что знаю лучше всего, а ты делаешь то, что понимаешь лучше всего, верно?~
@2400 = ~Джен'Лиг любит быть без обманной одежды. Вода ласкает чешую, как любовник.~
@2401 = ~Ох, извини, миледи. Я не смотрел в твою сторону, эх, и не в твою, конечно. (Ныряет в воду)~
@2402 = ~Начинает петь *Летом, в хорошую погоду...*~
@2403 = ~Я бы предпочёл купаться при свете Селуны, но это лучше, чем совсем не купаться.~
@2404 = ~На что ты пялишься, ты! Ты думаешь, у меня на коже мех, что ли? Буззарк!~
@2405 = ~Прямо как в старые добрые времена на пляже в Бороде Ульгота, с Джолан и остальными. Какая прекрасная идея, Сандра!~
@2406 = ~Ой, вода тёплая. Попробуй сделать это в Норхейме, и ты станешь ледяной глыбой даже летом.~
@2407 = ~У меня не было такого простого и невинного удовольствия с тех пор, как я была маленькой девочкой, ура.~
@2408 = ~Спасибо, Лорд Ильматер, я уже начала чувствовать себя слишком грязной. А ты - смотри в другую сторону... МУЖЧИНА!~
@2409 = ~Это удовольствие и привилегия - умереть рядом с тобой. ~
@2410 = ~Леди, с дороги. Сейчас я продемонстрирую тебе мой лебединый нырок!~
@2411 = ~Ты никогда не будешь слишком стара для здорового веселья.~
@2412 = ~Вода? Я её никогда даже не пью!~
@2413 = ~Давайте сольёмся с природой такими, какими природа создала нас. ~
@2414 = ~Кажется, что этот кусок ткани и дневник скаута как-то связаны.~
@2415 = ~So that was the scene I witnessed way back then, the ambush on the travellers. The occasion where I found the piece I gave you. I was the drow that as usual was considered to be anyone's enemy just because I was there.~
@2416 = ~But you are also our witness that the children with the travellers could escape.~
@2417 = ~'tis that mine assumption was right with this cloth piece, it was lost here way back then. The children that were so much sought after and cared for, they musta been special ones.~
@2418 = ~Whenever I read about those Time of Troubles, it scares me a lot. I am glad we live in lighter times now.~
@2419 = ~Those times cast a long, long shadow, Finch. They can block off the sun even for us today.~
@2420 = ~I hate these riddles. Why this complications, gut every male swine that is involved and the truth will come out by itself.~
@2421 = ~Lotsa little children were carried cross the coast back then. Soothing for me I wasn't the only one hiking around with ol' Puffguts.~
@2422 = ~What we have is the story of two baby children on a flight across the Sword Coast. From where to where? Mmh. They are protected by one party, the travellers. They are pursued by one or more other parties, at least the one that attacked and the one from Thay. But they escaped, leaving those torn cloths behind, that remind me of something I should know but cannot recall.~
@2423 = ~I think my head is spinning a bit. It is a confusing tale, it seems to be connected with you, but will it help us with our urgent problems at hand?~
@2424 = ~As much as I can understand your constant seeking for tales from the past, I do not see anything we can do with the information we have gathered. This trail is old and cold. How can it lead us to our ever pressing enemy of today?~
@2425 = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>, there is no direct hint to anything we would need at the moment. It does not yet help us directly. Unless we get to learn more by any chance the trail is as cold as you said.~
@2426 = ~It is still, I cannot get these children out of my thoughts. They must be nearly grown by now, about our age if they have survived. And somehow their tale is entwined with ours.~
@2427 = ~*For one short moment, a thought rushes through your mind. You are an orphan that came to Candlekeep with Gorion just about that time, seemingly out of nowhere...*~
@2428 = ~Let us stop for a moment, <CHARNAME>. I want to develop the theory I have made out of the different items we found and the information we gathered in addition. I think something has emerged from it, even if it is not totally clear yet what the connection is to our current quest.~
@2429 = ~* Sandrah appears to be obviously excited. Whatever she has found out touches her deeply.*~
@2430 = ~'tis not only thee that is feeling such.~
@2431 = ~Are you well, Sandrah. You look like you have seen a ghost.~
@2432 = ~A ghost indeed. Maybe worse.~
@2433 = ~<CHARNAME>, we gotta listen. I don't like how my besta friends looks now. Gloomy.~
@2434 = ~I know this feeling of the past trying its prying fingers into present life, like the Spiderqueen trying to hunt the renegade on the surface.~
@2435 = ~Helm's ever watching eye will keep safe those that do not follow false gods.~
@2436 = ~Those two children with the travellers were Bhaalspawns.~
@2437 = ~Hunted by some while others tried to hide and save them. From the time of occurrence that would make sense. But its the bad hunting for them and the good trying to save them?~
@2438 = ~And one of them might have been the one your mother gave life to. I see your interest in them now. But it seems they have survived. But who were the ones who tried to save them - and why?~
@2439 = ~One of them was the other child my mother gave birth to. Covered in the cloth with the emblems of my father's house. But the other child? The Othlor's scout thought it was a Bhaalspawn as well. So, was my own father one of those travellers? He and his Harper friends were trying to save the spawns? ~
@2440 = ~I hath sensed the Bhaal presence in this cloth all along. Has the renegade Othlor finally found them or has he found another one for his purpose?~
@2441 = ~Let me tell you a story of my people and the northern pirates. One of our captains who was hunted by a fleet of their black boats happened to escape with his ship between the cliffs of an island. He told his men to throw wooden planks and old barrels and some clothes overboard. The tide moved the relics towards the pirate fleet and the pirates sailed away thinking that our ship has wrecked on those cliffs.~
@2442 = ~You mean these cloth pieces served a similar purpose. The hunters should find them and think the children were no more.~
@2443 = ~I heard a story once from a captain you manoeuvred his ship between the dangerous cliffs below Candlekeep in escape from a fleet of pirate boats. He told his men to throw wooden planks and old barrels and some clothes overboard. The tide moved the relics towards the pirate fleet and the pirates sailed away thinking that our ship has wrecked on those cliffs. These cloth pieces could have served a similar purpose. The hunters should find them and think the children were no more. So you are hunting your own brother or sister now. Do you think its the one responsible for what is going on at the Sword Coast?~
@2444 = ~So you are hunting your own brother or sister now. Do you think its the one responsible for what is going on at the Sword Coast?~
@2445 = ~The answer is not so easy, <CHARNAME>. I think that the events we are trying to discover, this Iron Crisis, the bandit raids, and the rumours of war with Amn are indeed machinations of one who wants to profit from them to gain power. And gaining power is what a rising Bhaalspawn would be after, in conjunction with major bloodshed.~
@2446 = ~But is the Bhaalspawn that I see behind this the same one that my father once tried to save? Mind again that this spawn is not really brother or sister to me. And mind that a Bhaalspawn is a powerful being, but not necessarily evil.~
@2447 = ~The prophesy of Alaundo says that all Bhaalspawns aim at power and that there will come a time of war between them for power.~
@2448 = ~True, but Alaundo says nowhere that the fight for power is because they all have the same aim - the Throne of Bhaal. Maybe one of them uses his powers for a better aim.~
@2449 = ~Elminster would try to save a Bhaalspawn to use its power to fight those spawns trying to raise to power in their father's wake. Or maybe two of them, in order to make sure. One of them being of his own beloved wife Khalindra, thus giving her death a special meaning - the god of murder in the end defeated by his own cunning plan.~
@2450 = ~Thank you for the welcome, Rhanthona, although I have well heard the slight hint in it regarding my absence.~
@2451 = ~Milady, it was not intended as criticism, we just miss your joyful and encouraging presence here. Your father has advised us on your mission which we follow with great interest. The fame of your ventures reaches us regularly. So this must be the famous <CHARNAME> then?~
@2452 = ~Famous? I have not known that the Temple of Waterdeep has such an interest in me.~
@2453 = ~You know about my father's interest in you already, and the temple has an interest in you and me - and many means to receive information from the Realms. Be sure that little of what we accomplish remains unnoticed for long.~
@2454 = ~Do not be irritated, young friend, your way is a special one and much depends on your actions, and the actions of our priestess as well.~
@2455 = ~Let us stop now, Rhanthona, before we give <CHARNAME> the impression that Mystra's disciples are trying to mingle with <PRO_HISHER> fate.~
@2456 = ~I am sorry, Milady, if my words should have given that impression. No, young friend, your fame is spreading by your deeds and many follow your progress with interest. It is not the nature of Mystra to interfere with the decisions of the mortals. Even if our priestess is by your side, she does all of this on her own responsibility.~
@2457 = ~Thank you, Rhanthona...~
@2458 = ~Before you continue onwards, Milady, if your time allows you may want to pay a visit to the Inner Temple with your friends. We have taken care of a problem case here but we are stuck in our progress. I assume that your healing talents may assist us to accomplish a result.~
@2459 = ~We have already dwelt here long enough, Sandrah, our own mission calls us forward.~
@2460 = ~Lead us to the Inner Temple, Sandrah, let us see what we can do.~
@2461 = ~They seem to hold you at high esteem here, Sandrah. Another of your little secrets.~
@2462 = ~Aaah....little one,...are you fine...?~
@2463 = ~I think I am - I have been away long, like in an endless dream. But you, milady, what is it with you?~
@2464 = ~Aaah...do not worry, Leyala, I will be fine soon...just a bit of rest for all of us.~
@2465 = ~I was very sick before the dream began but now I feel well. Have...have you done that, milady?~
@2466 = ~This here is Mystra's temple and I am one of her healers. I am glad you feel better, Leyala.~
@2467 = ~Yes, this is Mystra's temple, you look just like the goddess as I saw her in my dream state...~
@2468 = ~What do you intend to do with our comrade's body, greedy vulture?~
@2469 = ~(Mumbles) Magnificent material...bones...sinews...Eh, what is it, healer girl?~
@2470 = ~Step back, necromancer, or you will feel the whole wrath of Mystra! This body is none of your business.~
@2471 = ~(We will see, we will see...the day will come when your body will be on my workbench...)~
@2472 = ~What is going on here?~
@2473 = ~The North East ward of town is of no interest to us, worker's quarters, markets, inns - the gates lead to northern wastelands and an abandoned Sune temple.~
@2474 = ~East of the Waukeen ward is where my home is, Elminster's house, also there is the famous Bloomwiffler's book shop and the most expensive restaurant of Faerun, Le Coq d'Or aux l'Eau Basse.~
@2475 = ~This ward is where my home is, Elminster's house, also there is the famous Bloomwiffler's book shop and the most expensive restaurant of Faerun, the Coq d'Or au l'eau Basse.~
@2476 = ~West of my father's house is the West Gate and the Commander's house, he is one of the Hidden Lords of Waterdeep.~
@2477 = ~North of Elminster's House is Mystra's Temple facing Mount Waterdeep which is tunnelled by the infamous subterranean Undermountain. ~
@2478 = ~Here we are at Mystra's Temple facing Mount Waterdeep which is tunnelled by the infamous subterranean Undermountain. ~
@2479 = ~Further to the north we can visit the fish market ward.~
@2480 = ~Right here we can visit the fish market.~
@2481 = ~A lot of things to see and visit, I admit.~
@2482 = ~Those were the Othlor's words. ~
@2483 = ~Dying Gods...Rising Gods..uuh scary.~
@2484 = ~In the Time of Troubles Gods had been slain. Thus says the wise Alaundo, that dead not all may remain. Bhaal may rise again and maybe others.~
@2485 = ~Had I only been granted access to the inner parts of Candlekeep to study Alaundo's writings. The prophesy of the dead God that will rise again. Bhaal.~
@2486 = ~Those like me who remember the Time of Troubles still tremble when they hear words like these. Ao has restored the balance when the revolting gods were slain. The rising of one of them or the rising of a new one on their behalf will mean the destruction of that tiny balance and a catastrophe for Faerun.~
@2487 = ~The peace after the Time of Troubles may be a tiny flower, easily to be trampled by those who lust for power. I do not believe in rising gods, but I fear those corrupt mortals and their deeds who follow such ideas.~
@2488 = ~The Time of Troubles, the slain gods, the prophecies of Alaundo concerning the spawn of the dead god Bhaal - my head is spinning. What does all of that have to do with us? I need fresh air, let us move on.~
@2489 = ~Say, little girl, do you have an idea where you last saw your mama?~
@2490 = ~My friends were right, hahaha, you <PRO_RACE>s always fall for that little girl in distress crap.~
@2491 = ~What is that? This is no thing to make jokes about, little one. ~
@2492 = ~We will use this little trick now more often, haha!~
@2493 = ~A wounded orc left behind. He must be from Knawlod's group, as there seem to be no other orcs in this camp.~
@2494 = ~UUUAAAH!~
@2495 = ~This orc then must know where Henning is!~
@2496 = ~He will not be able any more to tell us anything.~
@2497 = ~Please, please besta Sandrah, do something to make him heal, we need to ask 'im about my Henning, quickest help!~
@2498 = ~You really want me to heal this orc slayer that maybe has hurt your dear boy.~
@2499 = ~Sandrah, please, you must and must. If he knows where Henning is, we must know.~
@2500 = ~I will do as you ask. You will bear the consequences, Imoen.~
@2501 = ~This looks like the prison level.~
@2502 = ~Looka that door, uuh, it's locked. Must be the prison. HENNING! Are you in there?~
@2503 = ~Fine, Imoen, keep shouting like that, then we do not need to search all the wardens ourself. We just wait here and let them all come to us.~
@2504 = ~And they will fall one by one, from the hand of Imoen the Magnificent, ha! No one takes my loverboy and is spared, I tell ya.~
@2505 = ~Please, Imoen. A bit more restraint. We are near your boy for sure. We better sneak in most silently before they do him harm in the end.~
@2506 = ~Imoen, <PRO_HESHE> is right. We can do the big revenge once we hold Henning safely. You know about the cornered rat, do you?~
@2507 = ~Yeah, guess you gotta point there. They will bite an' scratch like dem rats and maybe hurt my darling in the end. Imoen the Shadow of Revenge will sneak up on them. Let's go.~
@2508 = ~Have your arms ready, when we open that door.~
@2509 = ~(You are still shocked about Imoen's strange transformation during the battle.)~
@2510 = ~Imoen, what the hell has happened? What was this creature? A demon? ~
@2511 = ~Are you well again, Imoen? Here, let me look at you?~
@2512 = ~I dunno what happened. A miscast spell from Tarnesh's spellbook maybe. I cannot remember anything clearly. 'twas all blood and blurry, n' I guess I killed some orcs with empty hands, huh?~
@2513 = ~To me it looked like more than a spell to be found on the pages of a third rate mage's spellbook. But I am not completely sure yet if it really was what I think it could have been.~
@2514 = ~I swear I will never do that again, that was really scary. I was so very strong and at the same time so helpless.~
@2515 = ~Right, we need to continue. I told you, Imoen, be careful with those spells, never use one you are not completely sure of. Especially not when we are in a combat like this. I need you, little one - and I do not want to lose you, little sister.~
@2516 = ~Sandra will you tell me about your suspicion? If there is anything we can do for Imoen, then you need to tell me. I do not want to lose my little sister.~
@2517 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, it is just a vague thought. I need to investigate further. It is not something to discuss now in the middle of this dungeon. We shall talk about it at a more quiet moment and after I have consulted with my book again on the topic. I hope that I was mistaken, but what we have seen could have been the mortal form of Bhaal. The Slayer. ~
@2518 = ~Bhaal again. Somehow this dead god is involved in all of this, and still we have no clue about how. But you are right, this dungeon is no place for further talk. Knawlod is waiting here somewhere.~
@2519 = ~<CHARNAME>, I must urgently take Henning to my father's house. Imoen, he will survive his wounds if I take him there to the care of Elminster and Mystra.~
@2520 = ~Please, please besta Sandrah, do everything to make him heal, quickest we go to Waterdeep!! Right, <CHARNAME>?~
@2521 = ~Hold on for a moment, Imoen. We have little time for this - we cannot travel all to Waterdeep - and do not forget, we will have all our enemies against us if we do not continue our strike now.~
@2522 = ~But what do we do? You do not give up Henning, no, you would never, I know you, Sandrah.~
@2523 = ~(Sandrah has taken a small item from her magical box. It looks like a very small splinter of glass but it starts to expel a soft blue light as soon as she holds it in her hand.)~
@2524 = ~Whatcha do, be careful, very very much.~
@2525 = ~Listen closely and do not discuss with me, <CHARNAME>, this is the only way to rescue Henning.~
@2526 = ~Sure, Sandrah, you have all our trust in that. We all want Imoen and Henning happily together once again. Do whatever must be done.~
@2527 = ~The one thing we don't need at this moment is some unnecessary hocus pocus.~
@2528 = ~This is a small splinter from Mystra's shard given to me by my father for the use to rescue my life if in the deadliest of dangers. It can be used one time only and only by one of Elminster's blood, like the Shard itself. It can take me to Waterdeep in an instant.~
@2529 = ~Oh, you wonderful besta friend of all, you will give this for Henning. But how?~
@2530 = ~I will activate it now to transport me and Henning to my father's garden and the altar of Mystra. ~
@2531 = ~I see that it needs to be done, Sandrah, even at the price of losing your help now at this crucial moment in our quest. Imoen, we will not hold her back. It is the only way to save Henning.~
@2532 = ~You propose to desert me at this crucial moment? No way!~
@2533 = ~<CHARNAME>, you prove yourself a competent leader once again. Do not worry about the task here in the mines. If this splinter works, I will be at Waterdeep in a moment. Once there with Elminster and Mystra, I am sure that they will have a way to locate you and send me back here to your side.~
@2534 = ~I cannot come with you, Sandrah, are you sure?~
@2535 = ~Poor darling, there is no way for you to come with us. The splinter only carries me and what I have on me. I can only take Henning as he is presently unconscious. And, Imoen, mind you, with all your multiple talents you still are no healer. What Henning needs now is healing and rest. When I am back we will find a way to go to him. I swear it as your *besta* friend.~
@2536 = ~Henning, I love you. And you too, Sandrah. ~
@2537 = ~Hush, <CHARNAME>, selfish idiot. Do not worry about the task here in the mines. If this splinter works, I will be at Waterdeep in a moment. Once there with Elminster and Mystra, I am sure that they will have a way to locate you and send me back here to your side.~
@2538 = ~Henning is at Waterdeep and my father has sent me back by means of the Shard. He sends greetings to all of you.~
@2539 = ~SANDRAH!!! Quickest tell me how is Henning.~
@2540 = ~(Takes Imoen in her arms.) Everything is fine, little one. Henning will be well again soon. Mystra herself oversees his healing, together with my father. There can be no better care on Toril than that.~
@2541 = ~I love you and love you and love you...~
@2542 = ~And I love you too, Sandrah. (You gently move Imoen aside to embrace Sandrah yourself.)~
@2543 = ~At least you kept your word and brought your hammer along.~
@2544 = ~I will never underestimate the worth of true friendship.~
@2545 = ~We will all be able to visit Waterdeep and meet Henning in a ten-day if we want. My father has assured me, that he will be completely restored by then.~
@2546 = ~Wonderful, I will dream about that now every night. <CHARNAME>, you slowpoke, let us crush these bastards now and clear out the mines. Let them know how it is to deal with Imoen, the Magnificent.~
@2547 = ~This is the courage we need now, friends. Let us get it on.~
@2548 = ~I'm sorry, but I have much to do in rebuilding my shattered consortium.  Perhaps we will meet again.~
@2549 = ~Did you have the chance to relish the quietness of your lovely cabin again, Aldeth?~
@2550 = ~Not yet, milady. And then, if you allow me to say, at the moment I am lacking the company to enjoy the place in the way it deserves to be savoured - on a warm lovely sundown with a distinguished lady of equal taste by one's side...oh I am dreaming.~
@2551 = ~I see the picture, Aldeth, it is quite enjoyable.~
@2552 = ~Maybe, if your time would allow...~
@2553 = ~I am afraid, Aldeth, the cabin will remain but a dream for foreseeable time, but maybe this town offers a place to enjoy oneself as well.~
@2554 = ~You are quite right, milady, with the right company and the necessary fantasy almost any place can be made into a small oasis away from the daily bustle.~
@2555 = ~And you know of such a place, maybe in the vicinity.~
@2556 = ~Let me take you there, sweet lady...~
@2557 = ~You must be on the trail of that strange man with the books.~
@2558 = ~He went to the mine, Emerson?~
@2559 = ~I warned him because of that spider infestation that had started the day before he arrived. But he just laughed and told me that the spiders were a good sign that he was at the right place.~
@2560 = ~In deed puzzling. Spiders as a good sign for what? What or whom may he want to find down there...?~
@2561 = ~That's what I asked him as well, but he just gave me one of his books for an answer. Here look yourself, you are far more knowledgeable than me, mayhap it gives you some hint.~
@2562 = ~In deed puzzling but it confirms what we had suspected. He was on his way to those who admire the spiders most of all. ~
@2563 = ~That can mean no good. Drow are worse than any danger of the deep we have encountered here so far. Good luck my friends~
@2564 = ~And what have your observations revealed to you?~
@2565 = ~Study on, I shall not distract your gaze.~
@2566 = ~Two bright new stars were born on the firmament just recently. One of them in Mystra's belt, the other is even more strange as it now adds to an insignificant unnamed constellation a new meaning - it is the old elvish symbol for *hope*. ~
@2567 = ~What meaning has the appearance of a new star for us? ~
@2568 = ~They were both born in the region of the night sky where the gods are represented. Strange indeed.~
@2569 = ~There are probably no new gods born these days. Anything else of more interest?~
@2570 = ~Any tales of the sea you'd like to share?~
@2571 = ~I've no time to talk to you.~
@2572 = ~Of the men of the sea I would be more interested in one named Monteelah...~
@2573 = ~Are you mad!! That name is DEATH itself!!~
@2574 = ~I know you, mirrorkin, and you be no more an Elminster than I'm Drizzt the Drow!~
@2575 = ~You said that these walls were soaked with innocent blood. Then who was it that chased me down these wretched halls, calling my name in voices I once knew, only to close and attack in trait'rous form?~
@2576 = ~What more proof do I need then you not knowing your own only daughter - doppelganger.~
@2577 = ~(Psst) Breagar, pretend to be interested, even if it untrue, it will serve the right purpose.~
@2578 = ~These clanless bastards do not deserve the name Dwarf. We will smash these snakes.~
@2579 = ~(Psst) Kagain, pretend to be interested, even if it untrue, it will serve the right purpose.~
@2580 = ~(Psst) Yeslick, pretend to be interested, even if it untrue, it will serve the right purpose.~
@2581 = ~Your faces are registered with me. Maybe I may have something for you today?~
@2582 = ~You mentioned pirate stories once, and maybe maps...of islands...~
@2583 = ~You are hunting pirate treasures. M'lady, 'scuse me, but you don't look that type.~
@2584 = ~ As you yourself once observed, fine cloth and good manners may hide the darkest soul beneath, all that has been seen in the Realms one time or another.~
@2585 = ~Ya mem'ry's as sharp as mine. Well done. A pirate it is. A name, a year, a face?~
@2586 = ~The island description is a bit vague, but maybe a name...How about Monteelah?~
@2587 = ~Puuh (Looks nervously around). Lower your voice, m'lady, maybe he's not as dead as he tried to make us think.~
@2588 = ~I have a good prescription against fear. ~
@2589 = ~Ya must be fearless, lady, few dare to speak that name at all.~
@2590 = ~I see, we are talking about the pirate Monteelah here? ~
@2591 = ~Sure, but we ain't talkin' much longer if ya keep repeating that dreadful name. Killed all his crew they say. Not one returned from that island where he's s'pposed to have hid his treasure.~
@2592 = ~None but him, you mean.~
@2593 = ~Ha, so you're clever, lady, few guessed that and fewer know. And none lives to tell.~
@2594 = ~Tell about his hiding up at the Beard before his death?~
@2595 = ~If dead he is. Ask dem up in Ulgoth's Beard if one saw the corpse. House burned down and he gone, but no corpse. Who's sure he's really gone this time?~
@2596 = ~And the island? Who knows about that?~
@2597 = ~Jus' him, with all other's probably dead by his hand.~
@2598 = ~Let us assume I knew what it looks like but not exactly where it is.~
@2599 = ~Dem guys at the Charter House in the Gate would know, if ever somebody charted it. But would they tell a lady like you?~
@2600 = ~Would they tell a captain?~
@2601 = ~If they knew him - you plan to disguise as one, he? Forget it...but...go to the Flushin' Mermaid, you may find one for hire, hahaha, but never let 'im run ya ship.~
@2602 = ~A drunkard? Maybe he serves to get the information from the Charter House and then we will see.~
@2603 = ~Always a pleasure dealin' with you. You understand your way 'round. Gotta go now, good luck. ~
@2604 = ~That was a quick disappearance. He must be really scared. Or he has another customer for the information he just got?~
@2605 = ~(Hiss) Young captain not much experience with Prime. Should not have said words. Not good in linear time of manlings to step out of sequence.~
@2606 = ~We should not be aware of things to come, you mean?~
@2607 = ~One like Sandrah will never accept what given to her without question or fight. If know what to come may try to change things in the now. Change thing in now ripples in consequence for things that are to be. If future is changed, then knowledge in now is wrong.~
@2608 = ~It will be a vicious circle, you mean. If I act today based of knowledge of the future I may change the future - but with that action the knowledge I had would have been obsolete...~
@2609 = ~Commander and Sandrah in union are strong for any future. Not need knowledge as they shape their own time line, (hiss).~
@2610 = ~Ya gal's got bright eyes an' a bright mind. (Spits)~
@2611 = ~You do not like what I was saying about your kin?~
@2612 = ~I Don't like it at all, that's for sure...I don't like it 'cause ya so damned right, gal. This IS dwarven handicraft down here, solid 'n' good. ~
@2613 = ~What is your problem then?~
@2614 = ~Problem is that ya right about dem duergar scum and blasted black elves as well, that's the problem. These caves have been lost by my kin long ago.~
@2615 = ~How about some house cleaning in this case?~
@2616 = ~Ha, that's the spirit, gal! Only...me guesses we will leave a nice bloody mess down here.~
@2617 = ~If you would throw your life away, then you are already dead. If that is your choice, then you do not need me.~
@2618 = ~You're a fool to love the bastard and a fool to oppose me!~
@2619 = ~If I must kill you to pass, then so be it. I do so forgiving you your transgressions against me. ~
@2620 = ~With Mystra's help I came into possession of a bowl that was taken from your mother. Perhaps now she will rest.~
@2621 = ~A ghostly mourner for another ghost?~
@2622 = ~An interesting story she tells, though incomplete. I shall make a note of it! ~
@2623 = ~Does she ever mention a location or event in her songs, somewhere her lost lover might have gone to?~
@2624 = ~Hm, nothing that makes much sense, a dragon castle where they fight evil. No one knows where that might be or when that may have happened.~
@2625 = ~Dragonspear Castle? A place full of lost souls...~
@2626 = ~(Ignore her.)~
@2627 = ~(Raise an eyebrow questioningly.)~
@2628 = ~Yes, lady, I heard that name a couple of times in her moans.~
@2629 = ~Several attempts were made in the past to drive whatever evil resides in Dragonspear Castle out of there.~
@2630 = ~Many brave men were lost and it is said that their souls are captured there and yearn for deliverance.~
@2631 = ~You mean that our ghost elf's lover might've been one of them?~
@2632 = ~I passed near Dragonspear Castle on my journey from Waterdeep to Candlekeep before I met <CHARNAME>. There was a group who called themselves *crusaders*, led by a charismatic female paladin. They were on their way to that castle. They talked about helping the lost souls. If they really had some success, this may explain why the singing has stopped.~
@2633 = ~The lovers finally united in death? How romantic...but bad for our business.~
@2634 = ~Have some bard make a tale out of it and it may turn out quite profitable.~
