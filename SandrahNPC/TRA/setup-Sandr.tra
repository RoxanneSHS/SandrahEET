@01 = ~Sandrah's Ring ~
@02 = ~Sandrah's Ring ~
@03 = ~Sandrah's Ring

This ring was given to Sandrah on her fifteenth birthday by her father in Waterdeep. It has a nearly unreadable inscription that could say: From your loving father E. to Sandrah, my daughter.
Sandrah will never part from this gift.

 Only usable by Sandrah ~
@04 = ~Sandrah's Amulet ~
@05 = ~Sandrah's Amulet ~

The amulet belonged to Sandrah's mother who died giving birth to another child. It seems to have great powers granted from Mystra herself.
   STATISTICS: unknown

Equipped Abilities: unknown
Only usable by Sandrah ~
@07 = ~Sandrah was born in Waterdeep as the daughter of one of the most famous mages in Faerun. Her mother died when she was one year old when giving birth to another child, whom she never got to know. Her father taught her many of the secrets of Mystra and the lore of the realms when he was at home - which was not often the case. Sandrah has inherited the wandering ways of her father. Currently she follows a vision she saw when secretly looking into her father's crystal shard - and also a mysterious dream that urges her to search for her mother's second child of whom nobody around her dared to speak. ~
@08 = ~History of Faerun ~
@09 = ~History of Faerun ~
@10 = ~Sandrah's personal copy of Elminster's rare History of Faerun
(not to be confused with the everpresent History of the North). This rare tome contains the comprehensive knowledge of items and places that the famous Elminster has visited and documented - which is indeed almost all of Faerun. Sandrah studies the worn book whenever time allows during your travels. 

The book can identify items provided you give Sandrah enough time to look them up.
(To identify an item, it must be in Sandrah's inventory - first initiate the book in her inventory, see the dialogue, second right click the item to be investigated.)

Sandrah's personal copy has the famous author's own signature inside of the front page : " To my d..(tea stain)..r Sandrah with love. Elminster", which makes it an even rarer item.~
@011 = ~Find the Petrified Priestess

Sandrah has told me today of a vision from her father's crystal shard. We must find and free a priestess from the North that has been trapped by a mage with a flesh to stone spell. We must find the reverse spell scroll at a temple and then detect the woman's statue in some festival or market area. ~

@12 = ~A Mysterious Young Woman

Today I met a young woman named Sandrah at the site of Gorion's murder. She claimed she had come too late and wants to help me now. I have seen her at Candlekeep before we left when my foster father had rejected her offer for help. Was that a mistake he made? Do I make the same mistake by refusing her help again. I feel like I should go back to her and try to find out more. ~

@13 = ~A Demonic Scroll

When we met the old mage Firebead today, he handed a strange Scroll to Sandrah. Only part of it is readable and it has a demonic aura with it. Sandrah will keep it until we eventually meet her father during our travels, as Firebead assumes that he may know more about the artifact. ~
@14 = ~Demonic Scroll ~
@15 = ~Demonic Scroll ~
@16 = ~"...need it if...go there where water roars and wolves howl...uninvited and fear the wraith of the mighty Alza...."

Most of the scroll you have received from the mage Firebead is unreadable from stains of dried blood. Sandrah has noted that the scroll is probably of demonic origin and has decided to keep it until either she or her father can find out more about it.~
@17 = ~A Demonic Scroll

Sandrah has studied the mysterious scroll a bit and found that it may - among other things - open some portal for or to someone named Alzaligundrel. We have no idea where this portal is nor what may lie behind it. We can only hope to gather more knowledge about the whole thing in the future.~

@18 = ~Rock~
@19 = ~Rock~
@20 = ~This is a large stone. There is nothing special about this piece of rock.~
@21 = ~A Demonic Scroll

Sandrah has found another bit of information from our mysterious scroll. Someone named Alzaligundrel is the master of this scroll. He has an archenemy in some mountains in the south. The enemy's lair seems to be near falling water. So what? All of it is still too vague to divert us from our task. I am waiting for Sandra or her father to find out more.~

@33 = ~Elminster's Shard ~
@34 = ~Elminster's Shard ~
@35 = ~Elminster's Shard

Elminster's famous tool, often referred to during your journeys with Sandrah. You can see any part of Faerun you want as through a large telescope. Sometimes even an event in the future becomes visible - for those you know how to use it. But even the Great Mage's own daughter cannot operate the tool for your use - or so she claims.~

@42 = ~A Demonic Scroll - A Deal

We have received the second half of the portal scroll to Alzaligundrel's lair. In order to save our lives, health and Sandrah's freedom we have made a strange deal with the demon Naronguth. We must bring him Alzaligundrel's Heart in exchange for Elminster's Shard. ~

Our meeting with Elminster has finally shed some light on the story behind the mysterious scroll.
    Elminster's Shard of Mystra has been Stolen!!
Demonic powers are at work and they threaten all of us on the Sword Coast. We must find them with the help of Sandrah and the scroll and retrieve the shard. Our quest leads us to the south of the Sword Coast, the Cloudpeak Mountains.~
@71 = ~A Demonic Scroll 
- Visit Firebead

We met with Sandrah's father, the mighty mage Elminster today. Demonic things are going on at the Sword Coast. But before we can really start to help, we need to retrieve a scroll from Firebead. He stays at Beregost, in a friend's house near the Feldepost Inn.~
@72 = ~A Bad Decision
Today Elminster has come to seek the help from my party in an urgent task for the Swordcoast at large. I had to deny because of my own preesing business although Sandrah pleeded with me to listen to her father. She has now left me to help the old man alone. I feel lost and sad. Will I ever see her again? and if, will she forgive me?~
@73 = ~A Demonic Scroll 
- Visit Firebead

We have retrieved a scroll from Firebead and brought it to Elminster. The demonic thing can converse with Sandrah. She and her father have found clues from the babbling of the scroll to some demonic activities and the missing Mystra Shard of Elminster. Another quest starts where one is done.~
@74 = ~Landrel ~

Sandrah has received a message from her father. Something must have happened that causes Elminster to require our assistance. We are to meet him at the temple in the Friedly Arm.~
@77 = ~A Demonic Scroll 
- Elminster's Quest Resolved

Finally we have solved the mystery of the Demonic Scroll and the theft of Elminster's Shard. We have returned the artefact to its rightful owner.
However, we also received a bit of a warning. The demons we struggled with may be defeated for the moment only - who knows if and when they may return.~
@78 = ~A Parcel~
@79 = ~A Parcel from Elminster~

@89 = ~Portrait of Sandrah's Mother

Portrait of a lady painted by the famous Leonardo. Price (of original): Astronomic
The young lady in the picture seems to be Sandrah at first sight. However Sandrah revealed to you that it is actually her mother painted by the famous Leonardo shortly before her wedding with Elminster. Even the miniature copy you found in your backpack after a mysterious dream gives you an idea of the beauty of the original which hangs in Elminster's house in Waterdeep.
With her enigmatic but lovely smile the mother completely resembles the daughter.~
@90 = ~Sandrah's Heritage - The second child

I had a kind of vision today. It involved Sandrah, her father Elminster, his dead wife Khalindra - Sandrah's mother - and a second child of no name or gender.
The vision also pointed at the Time of Troubles and the gods that had died there, of which I heard the Candlekeep chanters recite every day from the scripts of the Wise Alaundo.
      And the dead God of Murder - Bhaal.

But how are those things connected? And why was this vision given to me?~

@103 = ~ No, my husband...
         This bandit Khattark, he has the baby!~
@104 = ~Khattark - the Bandit

We have saved Hilath's baby from the bandit Khattark. But we had to make a deal for the babies rescue and Khattark himself could escape. He may try to hide in Waterdeep and continue his assaults on the town from his nest. We feel obliged to search for him when we get to town.~

@105 = ~Khattark - the Bandit

We have killed the bandit Khattark today, but the rest of his gang may still be in Waterdeep and may become a threat to the townspeople again, once they have found a new leader. We should keep our eyes open while in town. ~
@106 = ~Without Sandrah and her map we could not travel on to Waterdeep. ~
@107 = ~After a long odyssee in the wilderness we finally found our way back to the Friendly Arm.~
@108 = ~The Failed Journey to Waterdeep

Sandrah had invited us to her father's house in Waterdeep. On the road we encountered a frightening bandit leader who had kidnappped a child. I refused to interfer myself and proposed to leave the case to the Waterdeep militia. Sandrah has left my group without a word and went to help the poor child's mother and to restore her reputation in her hometown. Without Sandrah and her map we could not travel on to Waterdeep. After a long odyssee in the wilderness we finally found our way back to the Friendly Arm. Will I ever see Sandrah again?~

@127 = ~Naronguth's Return

Irritating news from Elminster. Our old friend, the demon Naronguth seems to be searching for us to regain his dancing slippers. The old mage gave us a pair of magically entangled shoes to assist us against Naronguth. How we can possibly get our enemy to put those shoes on will be seen.~
@128 = ~Copy of Naronguth's Slippers~
@129 = ~Entangled Slippers~
@130 = ~Entangled Slippers

From the look this seems to be a pair comfortable, attractive shoes, you'll never have to worry about blisters or stepping on your partner's feet. However these slippers have been modified by the mighty mage Elminster into a demon trap of sorts. How exactly the trap may work is unknown.~
@131 = ~ When Naronguth put on Elminster's Entangled Slippers and tried to attack you, he stumbled badly and went down in a ball of fire.~
@132 = ~Old Waterdeep Road

Today we have learned from Sandrah about the Old Waterdeep Road, a mystic trail from the Sword Coast to the City of Splendor used in older times. To find and travel it, one needs a special map. Sandrah suggested that the old couple that runs the Friendly Arm may know more about it.~
@133 = ~Elminster's Daughter

Today I finally discovered part of my companion's and lover's mystery:
Sandrah is the daughter and only child of Faerun's most famous mage, Elminster of Shadowdale, now residing at Waterdeep.
 
Although I have met the old man in various disguises and have already discovered that he and his Harper friends seem to have much interest in my fate, Sandrah has assured me, that she herself is not directly involved in her father's scheming. 

Her own personal interest - beside the love for me that she has discovered during our travels together - is not yet clear.

Like so many other things I learn bit by bit, she has assured me, that everything will be revealed in due time.~

Sandrah vaguely resembles a part of the pattern on this piece of cloth, but she cannot remember where she might have seen it. You need more pieces of the puzzle to make out some sense.~
@142 = ~Dynaheir's piece ~
@143 = ~Dynaheir's piece of Cloth
A piece of cloth that stirs up memories in Sandrah although she cannot yet exactly tell why. It was found by the Rashemi witch Dynaheir near the old Firewine Bridge. Dynaheir assumes that it was lost there long ago, at a period she called the Times of Trouble.~
@144 = ~Firewine piece ~
@145 = ~Firewine piece
An old caravan guard that went insane after he lost a caravan to the bandits long time ago had a piece of a torn cloth that is related to something in Sandrah's past.

@154 = ~Sandrah's Chainmail

Can a chainmail be a fashionable item? This one can. 
It is a powerful armour and at the same time it clings to Sandrah's body emphasising every female aspect of the young cleric's figure. The decoration is immune to any battle demolitions and is a work of art in the timeless style of Waterdeep.~
@155 = ~        A Strange Piece of Cloth - A Visitor

     Alarming things have happened. We seem to have stirred our faceless 
     enemy by finding a strange piece of cloth from the past. A wizard 
     appeared out of nowhere with mysterious warnings.
     But my courageous companion Sandrah has kept her cool and found a way to
     gain some useful information out of the whole confusing mess. It looks as 
     if a long past episode of history, the Times of Trouble, casts its dark
     shadow to the present.
     In a revolt for power against the overload Ao, several gods had once
     attempted and failed to overthrow the order and stole the tablets of fate. 
     The renegades were slain and new gods were enthroned in their place. But 
     this peace does not seem to be permanent. At least one of them - Bhaal - 
     has spawned a dangerous seed on Faerun which just now starts to grow.
     And it looks that me and my group have a part in that scheme without our

During your travels all over the Sword Coast, you and Sandrah have found three pieces of a strange cloth in various places. With the third piece in hand, you are finally able to reconstruct it. The reconstruction has given Sandrah the necessary clues. It is a bedcloth from Elminster's and Khalindra's household. 
Obviously it was used for Khalindra's second baby, the Bhaalspawn, during the time when it travelled from Waterdeep to an unknown destination in order to hide it from several groups of persuers. 
But why this was done? 
Who were the persuers?  
Who were the ones trying to hide and rescue this child along with another one of the same godly heritage?
Those are the questions you now ponder.

You can think of only one person to be able to shed some light on these issues
  - Sandrah's father, Elminster himself. ~

The continuos trouble will be accompanied by propaganda calling for a strong man to solve it all. Measures need to be taken to replace General Jedyan, as he may be respected by the population in such a role.~
@227 = ~ Plan, Part3

Establish operation basis at Friendly Arm. The location between Baldur's Gate and Beregost controls all exchange and travel between the two. The inn is already armed like a fortress. Nothing can suit our puposes better.~
@228 = ~ Plan, Part4

Infiltrate Baldur Gate Council. The reigning dukes will already be much discredited by the ongoing trouble, the next step to be detailed at our forthcoming meeting will be to finally replace the Dukes and access reign over the city ourselves.~

A symbol worn by the members and pupils of the Academy of Legencase. Sandrah, who has infiltrated the Academy once disguised as apprentice, proposed to bring the item to her father.

@238 = ~ Sandrah's Heritage - The second child

I am convinced by now that Sandrah's and my own stories are entwined. There is a Bhaalspawn in her past, and it looks like my heritage is somehow connected to Bhaal as well. Elminster has been following us around all the time since I had to leave Candlekeep and it was not to oversee his daughter's activities. We will go to Waterdeep and his time I will get some answers from him.~

@254 = ~ Travenhurst's Purse

This bag containing 9500GP was found on the dead kidnapper Knawlod, who had worked for the Beregost nobleman Gerard Travenhurst. The bag has the family emblem and the seal of Travenhurst on it. 
It will be evidence for the involvement of the council member in the Iron Throne's intrigues on the Sword Coast as well as his role in the kidnapping of Henning. 
The major of Beregost will have a large interest in this item.

@287 = ~ Shauhana's Sword~
@288 = ~ Shauhana's Sword

Shauhana prefers the use of her bow and only uses her flamesword when unavoidable. The orcish weapon had belonged to her father and was not given voluntarily to a daughter with only a part of orcish blood in her.~
@289 = ~ Shauhana's Bow~
@290 = ~ Shauhana's Bow

Shauhana becomes silent whenever the question of her relation to magic arts is adressed. She is the only female part-orc you have ever heard of to have any magic abilities. The origin of her bow is mysterious as well - it is clearly not orcish.
The bow requires no arrows but spits out salves of magical arrows when used by Shauhana, making her a kind of one-woman army against large groups of foes.~
@673 = ~ Shauhana's roots are a mystery on its own. The beautiful young woman shows no visible signs of her orcish heritage at first. Both her parents were only half.orcs themselves, but Shauhana grew up in the orc clan environment of the Stormhorn Mountains. More of her past was not revealed by the escaped slave-girl, but you are sure you will find it out over time when you and Sandrah built up a closer relationship with your new companion.~

A strange book to be found on an orc. Shauhana received it from her unvoluntary teacher Brage, who was caught by her Clan and put to the arena pits where she was enslaved. The mentally deceased fighter taught the half-orc girl the human language and reading. At least for one part of the book. The first part of it is written in an unknown script while the second part is an unfinished translation to the human language. The book contains very ancient mage lore and the second unknown part may contain even stranger secrets. ~
@299 = ~ Shauhana's Book - Part Two

Sandrah has identified the script of the original book as being of an old extinguished elven accent, that is even unknown to the elves and half-elves of today. One of the topics mentioned as far as Sandrah is able to decipher it by comparing it to some known inscriptions found on the Sword Coast that are recorded in her own enciclopedic tome, is the legendary Sharkta Fai.
Sharkta Fai - according to both elvish and orcish belief - is a fountain that is said to restore the bodies of those who have fallen in battle before they go hale to the next world after life. Some necromancers however think, that if a living creature bathes in the fountain, it will not only be restored with enourmous power but also will gain endless life.~

The ship creaks and the wind fills the sails. Slowly the ship comes into motion and leaves the shore. You soon get a feeling for the reaction of the rudder on your motions of the steering wheel. Sandrah finds more and more relations between the two books and figures out the right actions. Since the weather remains as good as it was proposed, the crew gets more and more cheerful.

Sailing goes smooth and on the morning of the third day the coastline gets into sight. And you discover a slight problem, as the rocky beach of the Sword Coast comes nearer and nearer...

The sailing was not a problem so far - but how do you stop the ship now?

The answer comes quickly as you hear the increasing noise of sand ,rocks and splintering planks rise up from the ship below you...~

After the initial shock had settled, I found to my surprise that Shar-Teel has happily accepted her coming role as a mother. In a way she sees this as a challenge to proof how a strong and independant woman like herself can raise a child with the love and care that she herself has never known.
And me? It will be quite some change but not the worst one. With the time still remaing we will beat our enemy and find a nice, quiet place to raise the baby. And others, who knows?

The authors and advocates of such tomes claim that, by drawing on the most recent theories in sociology and interpersonal psychology, it is possible to raise an individual's charisma by a single point. In truth, such increases in personal charisma are the product of magical spells placed on the text as it is in the writing process. These same spells also cause the tome to disappear after their first use. An excellent marketing strategy, you must concede...

What the studies of Narvantial and others reveal

The fate and history of Mystra has always been intervowen with the mortals of the primary plane. Since Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen, theory goes on to suggest that her own initial origin was mortal. While all the Gods in the pantheon are granted access to the power of the Weave and many pass part of that on to their followers, Ao is assumed to have chosen a human female to be the ultimate guardian of the Weave.

Through the ages, Mystra has gone through many incarnations, and the current is but one of them. The studies of Narvantial of Soubar, finished shortly before the Time of Troubles, revealed that all incarnations of the goddess stem from a single human bloodline through the female line. Before their raising to godhood, all human mages that became Mystra had been mothers and later incarnations of the goddess had always come from their blood. Narvantial pointed out the priestess Midnight as the heiress of that blood during his lifetime - and indeed Mystra's powers passed onto her servant Midnight who took her name and mantle after Helm had defeated the goddess in the Time of Troubles.

It should be noted that Midnight herself spawned a child while still being in her human form, the famous Elminster, alas a male. How her female bloodline continues that may probably produce a future incarnation of Mystra for a coming generation on Toril has not been found in the papers on Narvantial's studies that are still available today.~

Once again in your life the unexpected has happened! You are now the proud father of a little son. Of all the companions you have met on your travels so far, the mother is the one who appeared farthest from such a possibility when you first met her - the wildcat fighter Shar-Teel.

You know she will be a wonderful mother avoiding all the misdeeds she had suffered from her own childhood for your little boy. According to your agreement you have named the boy *Gorion*. He may not be a lone child for long.

You spend a couple of happy days with your little family and your other friends in Waterdeep. The further result of your stay may become apparent in some moons...Shar-Teel has not given you much rest whenever her motherly duties gave her time to show you her love. Her deepest wish at the moment is a little sister for Gorion. The road and the adventuring life do no longer attract her, it seems.

But that is not true for you. As much as you love your family and your little home in Waterdeep, the day comes mercilessly when you have to leave again.~

However neither Bhaal - like in my case - nor Myrkul - the godly father of her own grandfather Ghotal - are responsible here. Who else and how has fathered our companion then?~
@469 = ~ Shauhana's Mysterious Heritage

We have met the blind orcish seer Ghatlenk today and his son Wallrick, who was one of General Ghotal's adjutants. Shauhana has indeed inherited a mighty task from her grandfather - no less than to unite the Clan Orcs once again and to establish a balance of power between them and the southern nations to guarantee peace in the Realms. Her godly blood and our companionship are her instruments for this task.
We need to travel again into Clan's Land and reunite with Ghatlenk and Wallrick at the crossroad that leads to Sharkta Fai.
Wallrick reminded Shauhana of Minsc and asked her to make sure he would accompany her to clan's land.~
@470 = ~ Shauhana's Mysterious Heritage Unveiled
Shauhana is the daughter of the warrior god, Arvoreen, named also The Defender because he defends all that is right and good and destroys those who are evil. The orcs know this god by the name of Ilneval.
Arvoreen and Mystra have been tasked by Ao to re-establish the balance between the major racial nations on Toril.

It is a powerful armour and at the same time it clings to Sandrah's body emphasising every female aspect of the young cleric's body. The decoration is immune to any battle demolitions and is a work of art in the timeless style of Waterdeep.

After numerous tasks performed as <CHARNAME>'s companion, Mystra has rewarded her priestess and grandchild with several blessings to enhance this powerful item.~

And you've found the gold remains from the other tombs before:
With luck and skill you won't end up at Toril's core.
There must be fifty ways to kill your Kangaxx...

So don't forget to pocket pick, Rick,
When he's just a plain lich, Mitch,
You'll get two Rings of Gaxx, Max,

Act immediately.

Read your Protection from Magic, Vajic,
Or all read Scrolls of Undead, Fred,
But not until he's gone Demi, Remi,
Or he won't talk to thee.

Summon up a Wizard Eye, Guy;
Kangaxx can't imprison that, Matt.
Cast yourself a Spell Immune, June,
Abjuration's the key.

What sort of weapons does it take to fell this foe
Who's survived without a challenge since centureis ago?
Are they expensive and where do you have to go...
... To get rid of Kangaxx?

Some tools are pricey; perhaps you have no cash to spare
And you can't shoplift from Ribald as the Amnish Guard is there.
With all your abilities it doesn't seem unfair
To have a cheaper way of killing Kangaxx...
...Cheaper way of killing Kangaxx.

Wield the Improved Disrupting Mace, Grace,
Or the Sling of Everard, Gerrard,
You could use the Staff of Rynn, Lynn,
Better than +3.

Knock him down with Crom Faeyr, Blair,
Or the Magi's Stave, Dave,
Could try the Withereing Spear, Lear,

The oulaw has sworn his sword and life to Shauhana's mission.
Your counselor Sandrah has persuaded you to see the enormous potential Sureblade has shown as a General - even if it was for an army of bandits. Given the right task he would make a leader as Shauhana would need for her crusade.
As the rest of the bandits will quickly disband without their leader and Sureblade will hide until Shauhana needs him, your mission for Soubar is nevertheless ended successfully. Now you have to go back to the town pretending the villain's death and defeat and let the friendly town return to peace.~

The long odyssey that lies behind you and your beloved Sandrah has reached another climax. Your research with the Book That Writes Itself has revealed some striking new facts about her - and about you.

Not only is Elminster's daughter a descendent of the female bloodline from which all incarnations of the goddess Mystra have been elevated - she is also the only remaining one on the primary plane at this time. Either she or her daughters, should she ever have them, are to be Mystra's successor when the time for the next incarnation of the Goddess of All Magic and Guardian of the Weave is due.

And you - you were probably born to Khalindra to place Bhaal's deadly dagger right into the cradle of his most powerful opponent.

But is your and her fate really written? Have the two of you not gone your own unforeseen path regardless of the plans of any living or dead gods?

At least Sandrah claims that the last chapter in the book is still to be written - and that you and her will hold the quill that writes the story down.~

Sandrah has moved on alone to finally see Qilandrha as I have obviously failed one of the tests they have set up for admitting a Bhaalspawn to their inner sanctum. Her sister is a child of the dead god herself but has renounced Bhaal completely. Still she holds much of the essence his followers would require for their dark ritual. Thus her mistrust towards me.

Wherever possible they acted on behalf of the new Goddess Mystra.

Sandrah and her disciples played a major role in the reshaping of Faerun under the new pantheon. Their efforts and achievements made you wish from time to time you had yourself decided otherwise and become part of that force to build a plane worth living on.

About one year after the events you had witnessed the astounding news of a peace treaty between Rashemen and Thay spread through the Realms. Much to the surprise of the Orloths the move was initiated by Thay after it was discovered there that most of their magic and spells used in battle was no longer accessible to them - a change acosted by most to the new Goddess.

Trade became frequent between north and south through the Hornswamp passage, the orcs providing their excellent battle axes, the delicate Moose meat for the tables of the rich - and the miniature hamsters, that were on the wishlist of every child of the Realms in no time.

Sandrah and her beloved thieving bard Haer'Dalis have encountered the joint assault of Naronguth and Alzaligundrel, two foes they have in common for different reasons. The tiefling was killed in the battle and is now in a state that can neither be described as live nor dead. With her healer skills Sandrah is helpless when it comes to a descendent of the abyss who has been slain by another hellish creature while on the surface of the Prime. According to Mystra's advice Sandrah may be able to restore him in the abyss by using his murderer's own heart in the process. With the help of a map received from the Goddess of All Magic we can follow the villains and find the access to the nether regions this way. The trail leads us to the forgotten temple area in the Umar Hills.~
@740 =~How to restore a Tiefling

In persuit of Haer'Dalis' killer you finally make your way back to the Sword Coast and Baldur's Gate. Through secret passage ways - often with your eyes blindfolded - the Shadow Thieves manage to get your party from Amn to their headquarter up North within a day.

As you finally reach your destination you are vividly remembering the day when you last stood in the room you now stand in. It was the day when you entered the Undercity to face your *brother* Sarevok in his final battle.~

When she finally started her studies at the Temple of Waterdeep she soon specialized in the healing powers provided by the Weave. As a healer she will first try to restore her friends before plunging into combat again. However, when she picks up her blessed hammer her training soon becomes apparent.
Her special personal relationship to Mystra (again another story) provides her access to all the magic that falls into her goddess' domain. She thus has the ability to assimilate certain spells that are not available to priests of other deities.~

Like all of her kin she was raised by the varsh, the caretakers and wet-nurses of the githyanki, in one of their hatcheries located on the Prime. With the first days of adulthood, all githyanki are expected to train to defend the race against the two great feuds of the race - the illithid and the githzerai - with even those not part of its armies expected to have at least some training.
Jen'lig was selected for duties outside the normal command structure of the githyanki and assigned to an elite trusted to handle one of the most important tasks for the race, the protection of the silver weapons. Those magical artefacts are sought for by magic users of all races and must be traced and retrieved should they fall into the hands of a non-githyanki.
Jen'lig is an exception of the hr'a'cknir of her race, instead of divination and force she uses the strategies of those who steal a silver sword, namely the skills of a thief.~

The experience with Jen'lig is different from everything you have known before - and probably everything you will experience in the future. The body beneath those yellow scales seems to be on fire and her passion matches this heat.

Later you find that her earlier restraints have been swept away by your own fierce reactions to her body as you find scars and bruises from her talons all over your body.
In the heat of your embraces you have not felt any pain, just sheer lust and compassion.

One thing however is missing - there is neither a word nor a kiss from your lover's mouth. Instead she uses her long forked flexible tongue to explore and caress your body in a way no one has ever done before.

....

When you awake, you are alone in your bedroll. During the day there is no sign from Jen'lig to what has happened between you.
Only once she briefly remarks - *Was well to choose commander for lust. Jen'lig feels better for things to come. May do again if commander liked as well.* - She does not wait for your response...~

Our encounter with the stranded githyanki seems to have some unwanted consequences.

To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

@922=~Jen'lig's Hunt

I have allowed the githyanki Jen'lig to join my party. This strange creature from the Astral Plane is hunting for a relict of her race that has been stolen by some mortals. One of the thief was a flaming fist sergeant she had persued to the Friendly Arm Inn. The trail of his accomplices seems to point to Baldur's Gate. ~
@923=~Jen'lig's Hunt

Jen'lig has told me today that she searches a sacred silver sword from the city of Tu'narath that was once wielded by Gith herself, the heroine that freed her race from the slavery of the Illithids. Such an item must be of great importance to her race.~
@924=~Jen'lig's Hunt

We have found initial evidence for the relict our githyanki companion searches. It is the sheath of a sword stolen from her former commander Kastya. Six men seem to have been involved in the murdering of Kastya and the theft of the sword. One was the sergeant Horvok she had traced to the Friendly Arm Inn - five more need to be found.~
@925=~Jen'lig's Hunt

Another step forward in Jen'lig's quest. The bandit leader Tazok was one of Kastya's murderers. However, he did not reveal much more about the case before his well earned death.
One thing that bothers me is the fact that Jen'lig's possible success with her mission may as well mean a great danger for her - the godqueen of the githyanki is rumoured to assimilate the power and essence of strong kinsmen to prolong her own lichdom.~
@926=~Jen'lig's Hunt

When we defeated Kastya's murderer number three, Davaeorn, we found a warning letter indicating the names of two more complices, Jardak and Sunin in Baldur's Gate. It may be a good idea to contact the Shadow Thieves Guild in that town - such a guild is a good source for all kind of information, provided you grease their hands adequately.~
@927=~Jen'lig's Hunt

We seem to get nearer to Jen'lig's goal and to mine. The sorcerer responsible for her mentor's death and the theft of the holy sword is Semaj, a close confidant of my archenemy Sarevok.
With this common goal her loyalty to my quest seems to be assured until the final showdown. What she will do when we have succeeded, I can only guess...~

@931=~Imoen in Love?
Imoen urges you to hunt for a winterwolf. Henning, the shopkeeper in Nashkel offers a reward for a pelt from that animal. However, Imoen seems to be less interested in said reward than in seeing Henning again as soon as we have hunted down such a wolf.~
@932=~Imoen in Love?
It really seems that your *little sister* Imoen has some romantic interest in the handsome and charming shopkeeper of Nashkel. If you want to keep a rebellion within your party down, it is advised to visit the little shop in Amn now regularly.~
@933=~Heal Wounds~
@934=~Heal Wounds (Healing)
Level: 2
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

When casting this spell and laying his hand upon a creature, the healer causes 11 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.
Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just as any normal injury.~

@955 =~The kidnappping of Henning

A new development. We are following the trail of those orcs who have captured Imoen's boyfriend Henning. It seems that our investigations and the reopening of the Nashkel mines by us have forced a large and mighty organisation to act against us. 
The trail had at first pointed to the uncharted Cloakwood Forest. But meanwhile we found a witness that told us the orcs with their prisoner are unsure of their route and are currently on their way to the halflings village of Gullykin.~
