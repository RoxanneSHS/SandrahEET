1. If main hero is female and Shar-Teel is in the party, player can start PID with Sandrah about Shar-Teel and
romance with both of them together, but there is not Shar-Teel romance for female main her.
2. After Xan quest for saving slaves and walking them in Friendly Arm, the very next day there is mail to us
from them. They probably would have wait for longer in Friendly Arm before leaving it.
3. Talk to Marl is interrupted, it should be possible to return to the original dialog with him, using
replicas like "Wait, what did you want to say"(to continue the original dialog) and "Guys, we are not the ones, you are looking for" (to stop
dialog) after Sandrah talked to him.
4. It can be wrong order of dialogs Elminster can give you a quest with Demons and than meet you in Beregost
after Nashkel. Elminster will say to Sandrah that she should tell anyone that he is her father. But we already
know it from him.
