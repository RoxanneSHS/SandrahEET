== BSANDR ~ Xan, fear is a warning signal from our experiences and we should carefully listen to it. But we should not let it rule ourself. If fear paralizes our actions, it becomes more dangerous than our enemies. But if it warns us to tread carefully and with caution, it makes us survive.~
== BXANNN ~ You are again wise past beyond your actual years. I am afraid I have seen too much of this slaughterhouse we wade through, my fears seem to overwhelm all rational thinking.~

But when the moment comes to move into action, I have never seen any look of panic in your eyes. You plunge into battle like a disciple of Tempus. I must know, because I have to take care of your wounds afterwards.~

== BKIVAN ~  A happy man, even in his loss. I served Khalreshaar, the Lady of the Forest once, Sandrah. Now it is Shevarash, the Black Archer, I say my prayers to. Those who serve Shevarash lose the ability to feel pain, as all that was dear to them had been taken away. Your father had you, which may have saved him. ~
== BSANDR~  So, my friend, we need to find such a solution for you as well.~
== BKIVAN ~  When Tazok is dead, I will return to Shilmista to start my journey to Arvanaith. I am but a black arrow on Shevarash' bow. ~
== BSANDR~  My father was not granted the chance to avenge his beloved wife. The vile deed of the God of Murder was done from even beyond the murderer's grave. And still he gave meaning to his life, to my life and too many, many others throughout Faerun.~

Is it so irresponsible of us to make some experience in love first before our mind and brain follow us? Do you really need an answer that binds for the rest of all our lives right now?~

Honestly, he often did just that with me and those are very dear memories.~

==IF_FILE_EXISTS BSUFINCH~ For all? I am afraid not many people can afford the astronomic price for a copy of it.~
== BSANDR ~ That is not Elminster's fault, it is how the economy works. On the other hand, not many people on Faerun do really need all of the information contained within this tome. And most of those who could need it, would not be able to read it, sadly.~

== BVicon ~ (Viconia is silent for a while. It is obvious that she is not sure to come to terms with her own instincts.) Sandrah, to trust another woman in Menzoberranzan would most likely be asking for your own death. With you, however it is different.~
= ~ Yes, I kill when I must, and when I kill it is in an artful and painful way. But I am no murderer. Do I not see you do that all the time, to kill because you must?~
== BSANDR ~ You are right, except I neither take it as an art nor do I get any satisfaction from it.~
= ~ I understand, you had to kill, and those Fist mercenaries took the opportunity to call it murder?~
== BVicon ~ You are right, Sandrah. The law up here on the surface is for protection of the noble and the righteous. A drow could not even dream to receive justice from any of your courts.~
== BSANDR ~ As much as I hate to say it, Viconia, but I must admit that you are probably right. Any of our courts would sentence you to death for killing even the most depictable surfacer without giving you any chance to justify your deed. The surface has its dark sides as well, and you are an outsider and an outcast from the beginning - at least for most of those who think of themselves as good and righteous citizens. ~
== BVicon ~ But you do not, and <CHARNAME> does not.~
== BSANDR ~ Maybe, because <CHARNAME> has something of an outlaw in <PRO_HIMHER>, and all that follow <PRO_HIMHER> as well. We do good to look at things in more depth and come to our own unprejudiced conclusions.~
== BVicon ~ I killed a man and his son who had taken me in for some time. I was desperate from my long time of running away and hiding on the surface, and I was foolish enough to believe they did not despise me for my race. But I was wrong and I blame my own weakness for it. They took me in on a remote farm but their intentions were not good. They had heard the stories of the pleasures the women of my race can provide to the males, and they just wanted me as the slave for their sick perverted lust. When they tried it - both together - these cowardly bastards - I killed them with my bare hands.~
== BSANDR ~ So it was self defense, not murder. I have to agree that none of our courts would share my personal view on it.~
== BVicon ~ Even worse, as the other son of the man I killed was in the Flaming Fist, and it was him who took after me for revenge for his father and brother in the name of the law.~
== BSANDR ~ So he was not hunting you with the knowledge of his superiors but for a personal revenge disguised as the law. Good to know. So you are not a hunted criminal and we are not outlaws that shelter you.~

It were not the God you follow and the Goddess of Magic who seeded my father and are therefore my grandparents - it were the adventuress Midnight and a human thief name of Cyric that are his parents. With both ascending to godhood later, they have lost as well the connection to their former life on the material plane.

== BSANDR~ If your lore is so profound, Edwin, it has surely not slipped your attention that both, Cyric and Midnight, were masters of their own fate and even stood up against the gods themselves, assisting Ao to kill the false ones. Reflect about this aspect of my heritage as well, mageling.~

==BBRANW ~ Will you not weaken beside your husband by relying on him for protection? Will you not put the care for him - and for your children - above your valour for fighting?~
==BSANDR ~ Maybe those, the family, the home, my friends and all that will give me the strength to stand up and fight time and time again, Branwen. To keep up the spirit we have today while we are young into our later years requires strong motivation. Maybe you have yours from Tempus. I can tell you the lore of many respected heroes who found their motivation in love.~
==BBRANW ~ Love is indeed a strong motivator, my dear friend. What I am afraid of is, that it is a two-sided thing. Fear for the loss of the beloved may as well hinder the strong fighter.~
==BSANDR ~ As would doubt about the right reasons to risk your life. I am a cleric myself, Branwen, and I doubt that the duty for a god or goddess will ever be stronger than the love for the ones inside my own heart.~

== BSANDR~ For me they represent everything that makes magic and the arts provided by my goddess such a two-sided medal. The red scum are the downside of it, the incarnation of the misuse of Mystra's powers.~
== BDYNAH~ Fighting Thayan invading armies and their wizards ensures our survival, Sandrah, so it cometh natural for me. A Rashemi doth no more than guard his house. Thine reasons are far more abstract.~
== BSANDR~ Maybe, but any of them I encountered until today has added to my bad impression of Thay. Meddling in Necromancy, basing their society on slavery and keeping their women at a similar low level - name any despisable attitude and you will find it in Thay.~
== BDYNAH ~ Thayans are a nation which breeds wars, and thus is bringing on the demise of humans. Szass Tam, the current ruler of Thay, was born decades earlier than me, and now he continues his existence as a lich. ~
== BSANDR~ They do not respect even death and nature itself. They melted glaciers with their magic to make the meltwater caused flooding in Immilmar and Mulsantir.~
== BDYNAH~ Me and my sisters went to repair damages and salvage what we could. Meanwhile, Thayan forces crossed the foothills of the High Country.~
== BSANDR~ In my lessons on the Realm's and Toril's history I have learned of the wars between Rashemen and Thay. My heart is always with the righteous side, Dynaheir, and Rashemi gained my respect by standing against these armies of evil for so long.~
= ~ But there is another issue I want to bring to your attention and maybe you can provide some council on it.~
== BDYNAH~ I gladly wouldst if I have any to provide.~
== BSANDR~ I have mentioned my opinion on the Red Scourge to <CHARNAME> on occasions. I probably have acted with too much visible emotions and have lost my standing as a counselor with <PRO_HIMHER> on that subject. It will be hard for me to prevent <PRO_HIMHER> now from getting involved with them, should one of them slime his way into our group.~

Not an odd choice for your grandmother. However what made him special and won him her heart was his sacrifice of the own self when the final battle neared.~
== BSANDR~ It was him, not Midnight that ended the God of Murder.~
== F_DRIZTJ~ Exactly. It was Cyric with the help of Mask in the form of the sword Godsbane that backstabbed the God of Murder as the pair had tracked him down and cornered with no means to escape. With all her power and weaponcraft, Midnight could not hit the final blow against him. Only the skilled noiseless assasin with the undefeatable sword could backstab and murder this god.~
= ~ But more important - just like Midnight took Mystra's mantle and sacrificed her humanity and her womanhood to take the duties of a goddess, Cyric did likewise. His burden was heavy as he had to become the new god of murder by Ao's verdict and the great schemer and plotter we recognise in him today.~
== BSANDR~ Understandable that a man of integrity who has to take on the duties of such deities will appear broken in his personality. A short step from the thief with his tricks and masquerades to the mad god of strive, lies and illusions, but a thin line easily overstepped.~
== F_DRIZTJ~ (Drizzt looks at Sandrah in deep thought.) You see what only she was able to see before. Another indication of your resemblance. May you be very careful for how far you will follow her way.~
