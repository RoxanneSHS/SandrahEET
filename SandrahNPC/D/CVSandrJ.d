Right, one of the instruments in my father's study, one that he uses in his many activities to observe the realms and certain activities that he and his friends are interested in, is the Crystal Shard. ~

(Laughs) after all I am my father's daughter, and he is known to interfere with quite a lot of things throughout the four corners of Faerun. ~

Bane went to the City of Tantras where He was slain in battle with Torm, but Torm had perished as well. Bhaal was slain by Cyric, who wielded the magical sword Godsbane at Boareskyr Bridge.

As could be expected, the children that were spawned by Bhaal all at the same time, shortly before his destruction, reached the age of adulthood. If you trust Alaundo - or rather the interpretation that is believed by the most - this would be the time when they would become aware of who they are, and according to the prophesies would begin their rush for power.~
