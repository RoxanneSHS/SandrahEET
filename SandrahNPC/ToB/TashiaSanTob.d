~Is that a look of approval on my spellcasting, Sandrah?~
DO~SetGlobal("SanTashiaB","GLOBAL",2)~
==BSandr25~(Laughs) Oh, no, even as a disciple of the Goddess of All Magic it is not my role to judge other's talents. I was just once again fascinated by the fact that sorcerers have such a natural feeling and skill for their art, other than the scroll users that recite their texts.~
==BTashi25~I understand it is not so much different from your own way - even if you in person seem to be different again from all other priests I have encountered.~
==BSandr25~You are right, some abilities come to me almost naturally - I guess pretty similar to your own experiences.~
==BTashi25~Yes and no - I still see a slight difference as I get new spells to my repertoire with experience but they are, hm, traditional arcana. You seem to *invent* new stuff which is based on the personal experience you make.~
==BSandr25~Hm, I have never given it much thought before but I guess that is a valid observation. I often discovered some new ability after a ceratin experience I made or a foe I defeated.~
==BTashi25~Do you have some explanation for it - I mean even for Mystra's priests that is quite unusual?~
==BSandr25~If it is not a very special talent than it is maybe my blood relationship to the Goddess.~EXIT

~All those healing spells of yours are something that are not granted to me.~

==BSandr25~As a priestess I have specialized from the beginning in this aspect of the Weave's powers. The spells are just a tool, Tashia, I have tried to learn much more about the physical and spiritual bodies of the mortals in order to help and heal them.~
==BTashi25~Do you think you would have become a healer even if you had not the access to magic?~
==BSandr25~Hm, I probably would, even if that task would require much more dedication and time for the patients. I could never have gone on an adventuring quest like we do as the quick help and first aid required in our battles would not be possible without magic.~
==BTashi25~Mystra be thanked for it then.~
==BSandr25~Still I study the non-magical arts whenever I can. Especially the mind and the temper of a person can rarely be cured by some quickly cast spells. If you want to help a grieving or distorted person you must take your time and explore the other one deeply and carefully.~
==BTashi25~One must be a very caring person to offer such help...maybe one day I may ask you about that again.~
==BSandr25~I will always take my time for you, be assured, Tashia.~EXIT
